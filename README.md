## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a confessional monologue from a junior aide who discovers the First Minister's secret journal, torn between loyalty and conscience.
- Script the tense, private conversation between Mhairi (head of communications) and Sir Jeremy Cathcart where they negotiate the 'management' of the First Minister.
- Create a series of leaked diary entries that show MacAulay's internal moral decay, juxtaposed with his soaring public rhetoric.
- Write the chapter where MacAulay, alone in his official residence, finally reads the damning historical precedent from the Scottish Enlightenment he's been ignoring.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build a 'Power Corruption Simulator' that models MacAulay's key decisions, tracking his public approval, private morality, and Westminster leverage in real-time.
- Create a 'Confessional Text Analyzer' that compares the private journal language vs. public speech language, visualizing the divergence over the novel's timeline.
