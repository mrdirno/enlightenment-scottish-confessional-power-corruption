# Chapter 1

## **CHAPTER 1**

The rain on the window of the First Minister’s car was not Scottish rain. It was a soft, apologising London drizzle, greasing the pavements of Whitehall, making the black iron railings shine like liquorice. Alistair MacAulay watched it smear the world beyond the bulletproof glass. He was thinking about the weight of a stone in his hand, the cold, certain heft of it pulled from a drystane dyke. A weight that promised a simple outcome: throw it, or don’t. Not this. Never this.

“You’re quiet, First Minister.” The voice from the opposite seat was a study in polished neutrality. Sir Jeremy Cathcart, Permanent Secretary. A man who wore his knighthood like a particularly well-cut overcoat.

“I’m listening to the rain, Jeremy,” MacAulay said, not turning. “It sounds… English.”

A faint smile. “All rain is H₂O, First Minister.”

“Aye. And all whisky is ethanol. The difference is in the making, and the taking.” He finally looked at the other man. Cathcart was arranging invisible lint on his trouser leg. “This meeting. The Prime Minister’s tone. ‘A private chat before the devolution review.’ What does he want?”

“One assumes he wants to chat. Privately.”

“He’s a public schoolboy who thinks governing is a debate he can win with a raised eyebrow. He doesn’t chat. He deploys charm. It’s a tactical weapon.”

The car slid through the gates, a silent, armoured shark. MacAulay felt the shift, the atmosphere thickening from city to citadel. He was a trespasser here, always. The elected leader of five million people, entering the administrative womb of a state that had, for centuries, viewed his country as a resource, a problem, or a punchline.

His phone buzzed in his pocket. A single text from Mhairi, his head of communications, waiting back at their temporary offices in Dover House: *Remember. You’re not a supplicant. You’re a head of government. Albeit one they wish would stop using the word ‘sovereign’ before breakfast.*

He thumbed a reply: *I’ll try to say ‘autonomy’ instead. Sounds more like a washing machine setting. Less threatening.*

The door was opened by a young man with the earnest, bloodless face of a junior diplomat. “First Minister. Sir Jeremy. The Prime Minister is ready for you in the study.”

They were led not to the grander reception rooms but down a quieter corridor, lined with portraits of men who had managed empires. MacAulay caught his own reflection in the glass over a painting of some long-dead Viceroy of India: a tall, angular man in a dark suit, hair the colour of winter bracken, a face that looked carved from old wood. A face that belonged on a hillside, squinting at the weather, not here, breathing this scent of beeswax and latent power.

The study was all restrained masculine luxury: leather, mahogany, the faint, sweet smell of cigar smoke embedded in the curtains despite the ban. Prime Minister Leo Thorne stood by the fireplace, one elbow on the mantelpiece, a portrait of casual possession. He was ten years younger than MacAulay, glossy, his tan suggesting a recent weekend somewhere the sun was considered a right, not a rumour.

“Alistair! Good of you to come in. Jeremy.” Thorne moved forward, hand extended. His grip was firm, calibrated. “Drink? Whisky, of course. For the occasion.”

“It’s eleven in the morning, Prime Minister.”

“And you’ve had a long drive. A restorative. The Balvenie? Or I’ve a rather peaty Islay that’s meant to be ferocious. Like your backbenchers.”

MacAulay accepted the Islay. “The peat’s honest, at least. It tells you what it is.”

Thorne laughed, a bright, practised sound. He poured for himself and Cathcart, then settled into a wingback chair, indicating the one opposite. Cathcart took a seat by the door, a silent scribe.

“So,” Thorne began, swirling his glass. “The review. Big moment. Ten years since the last powers transfer. The Commission’s report is… thorough.”

“It’s a list of what we already know. The fiscal framework is a straitjacket. The welfare powers are half-eaten. We can’t respond to a recession because we’re not allowed to borrow to invest. It’s administration, Leo, not government.”

“Governance is often administration, Alistair. The careful, responsible management of resources.”

“It’s the management of decline. And we’re told to be grateful for the tools.”

Thorne’s smile didn’t slip, but it cooled. “You’ve been making that case rather colourfully. ‘The democratic deficit.’ ‘Westminster’s dead hand.’ Strong stuff. It plays well in the Glasgow halls, I’m sure.”

“It plays because it’s true.”

“Truth is a flexible companion in politics, as you know.” Thorne leaned forward, elbows on knees. “Here’s my truth, Alistair. My backbenchers are restless. English votes for English laws, all that. They look north and see a parliament that gets to spend money they don’t raise, on policies designed to embarrass the UK government. A permanent opposition, funded from the Treasury. They’re asking: what’s the union dividend for England?”

MacAulay took a sip. The whisky was indeed ferocious, a smokehouse blaze in his throat. “The dividend is a stable northern border. A shared defence. A cultural heft you can’t buy. Or it’s nothing. In which case, let’s have the conversation you’re so determined to avoid.”

“The independence question?” Thorne sat back. “Lost. Decisively.”

“A generation ago. With a different electorate. Under different promises that were broken before the ink was dry.”

The room went very quiet. The only sound was the gentle hiss of a gas log fire, pretending to be real.

“This is the private chat, Alistair,” Thorne said, his voice lower, the charm shelved. “The review will recommend some minor fiscal tinkering. Symbolic. You’ll hail it as a step forward. We’ll hail it as a sensible settlement. The status quo continues, amiably.”

“And if I don’t? If I go out there and call it the insult it is?”

Thorne glanced at Cathcart, then back. “Then the status quo continues… less amiably. The Scotland Act has a thousand levers. Most of them are about cooperation. The funding formula, the block grant… these are annual conversations. They can be… robust. Or they can be smooth. It depends on the tone set by the devolved administration.”

MacAulay felt the stone weight in his hand again. This was the threat, always unspoken, always present. *Behave, or we’ll make governing impossible.* He’d heard it for years, in softer language. Today, it was naked.

“You’re suggesting we moderate our democratic ambitions for a quieter life.”

“I’m suggesting,” Thorne said, picking an invisible thread from his sleeve, “that true power understands its limits. That shouting from the sidelines is not leadership. Your predecessor understood the art of the possible.”

“My predecessor was a professional complainer. He made a career out of managing disappointment. I have no taste for it.”

“Then you’ll find it a very bitter diet.” Thorne stood, signalling the end. “The offer is this: you temper your rhetoric on sovereignty, you work with us on the narrative of the review, and the machinery of government hums along. We can even find some infrastructure projects to announce. A bridge, perhaps. People love a bridge.”

MacAulay rose, leaving his half-finished whisky on the table. “I didn’t come into politics to build bridges for you, Leo. I came to question why the river was a border in the first place.”

For a second, Thorne’s mask of amused reason flickered. Irritation showed through, sharp and cold. “A pretty line. Save it for the conference speech. Just think on what I’ve said. The wellbeing of your people is in your hands. Don’t let pride make their lives harder.”

The dismissal was absolute. MacAulay turned and walked out, Cathcart falling in behind him like a shadow. They didn’t speak until they were back in the car, the London streets beginning to blur again.

“That went as well as could be expected,” Cathcart said, tapping something into his phone.

“Did it, Jeremy? Did it really?”

“He showed you the stick. The next meeting will be about the carrot. It’s the dance.”

MacAulay stared out at the passing monuments. “I’m sick of dancing. I feel like a trained bear in a circus. And the music’s getting slower.”

His phone buzzed again. Mhairi. *How was the chat?*

He typed, his thumbs heavy. *He offered me a bridge. I think he meant it as a metaphor, but he’s so literal, he’ll probably announce one tomorrow. A bridge from his ego to my compliance.*

Her reply was instant. *Come home. The water’s just as wet, but it’s ours.*

The car sped towards the airport, towards the shuttle north. As the city receded, MacAulay felt the familiar, grim tightening in his chest. The meeting was a failure, but not in the way Thorne thought. The failure was his own. He had walked in knowing the script, and he had still recited his lines with a futile passion. He had shown his hand: the principled, unyielding Scot. And Thorne had seen it, catalogued it, and knew exactly how to handle him.

He thought of the stone in his hand. The clean decision.

But this was not a drystane dyke. This was a labyrinth, and the walls were made of paper—statutes, agreements, reviews, formulas—and they could close in on you until you couldn’t breathe.

*The wellbeing of your people is in your hands.*

That was the genius of the trap. They made you complicit in your own captivity. The threat wasn’t an invasion, or tanks on the Royal Mile. It was a quiet phone call from a civil servant: *I’m afraid the Treasury is querying that health allocation. It’ll be delayed. Purely procedural.* It was the slow, sanctioned suffocation of ambition.

By the time the plane lifted through the cloud blanket, a grim resolve had settled in him, cold and clear as the Islay whisky. Thorne wanted a manageable narrative. A story where Scotland was the plucky, troublesome cousin, eventually pacified by wisdom and a bridge.

MacAulay would give him a story. But not that one.

He opened his briefing folder, ignoring the dense paragraphs on fiscal multipliers, and turned to a fresh page. He began to write, not in the careful, bureaucratic language of government, but in the sharp, declarative sentences of a man who has reached a limit.

*The Scottish Enlightenment,* he wrote, *was not a request for permission. It was an assertion of reason. Of light. We have traded that light for the small, careful glow of a desk lamp in a Whitehall office. We administer the shadows they cast.*

*No more.*

*If they will only respond to force, we must become a force they cannot manage.*

*Not the force of a fist. The force of a fact. A truth so bright and undeniable it burns through their paper walls.*

He stopped, looking at the words. They felt dangerous. They felt true.

He didn’t know yet what that truth would be. Only that he would have to find it, or forge it. And that it would cost him. It would cost everything.

Below, the grey North Sea churned, indifferent. He closed his eyes, and for the first time that day, he was not thinking about stone. He was thinking about fire.

# Chapter 2

## **CHAPTER 2**

The wind off the Firth of Forth carried the smell of salt and diesel. It bit through the wool of Alistair MacAulay’s coat as he stood on the Parliament’s balcony, the cantilevered concrete boxes of Holyrood looming behind him like a cubist sermon. From here, he could see the ancient rise of the Castle, squat and volcanic on its rock, and the genteel sprawl of the New Town, a geometry of Enlightenment ambition. His city. A city of layers—medieval, Georgian, Victorian, modern—each stratum a different answer to the same question: who are we, and who governs us?

The door slid open behind him. He didn’t need to turn.

“You’ll catch your death. And then where would we be?” Mhairi Sinclair’s voice was warm gravel, a Fife accent worn smooth by years of media training, but never erased. She came to stand beside him, handing him a mug of strong tea. “Cathcart’s note is pure poetry. ‘A frank exchange clarifying respective positions.’ He means you shouted and Thonne looked pained.”

“He didn’t look pained. He looked bored. Which is worse.”

“Aye, well. To be expected.” She sipped her own tea. “The question is, what do we do now? The review announcement is in a fortnight. We need a line.”

MacAulay watched a ferry push its way towards Fidra. “What’s the line for surrender, Mhairi? ‘We fought the good fight, but their paperwork was superior’?”

“The line,” she said, patiently, “is ‘ongoing disappointment, but we will use the limited new powers to their fullest to protect the people of Scotland from Westminster austerity.’ It’s the line we’ve used for a decade. It works. It keeps us angry, and them the villain.”

“It’s a lie.”

“It’s a *narrative*.”

“It’s a palliative. A political morphine drip. It doesn’t cure the disease, it just makes the decline feel like a policy choice.” He turned to her. Mhairi was in her fifties, her dark hair streaked with silver she never bothered to dye. Her face was intelligent, tired, fiercely loyal. She had been with him from the backbenches, through the internal party coups, to this precarious pinnacle. She knew him better than anyone, which meant she was already wary.

“Alistair. What happened down there?”

“He threatened me with good governance. He offered me a bribe of normalcy. And I realised… I can’t do this anymore. The pantomime.”

Her eyes narrowed. “Okay. Let’s say I agree. Let’s say we’re all sick of the pantomime. What’s the alternative? Walk out? Collapse the government? That’s what the fundamentalists in the party want. It plays right into Thorne’s hands. He’d call a new election, blame us for chaos, and we’d be back in opposition, screaming from the sidelines. Is that better?”

“No.” He looked back at the castle. “Screaming is just noise. I want a voice. One that can’t be edited, or dismissed, or managed by Sir Jeremy Cathcart.”

“You have a voice. You’re the First Minister.”

“A voice with a hundred filters on it. Legal, fiscal, political. A voice that can only speak in requests, never declarations.” He finished his tea, the heat a brief comfort. “I need you to set up a meeting. The smallest circle. You, me, Ewan, and Isla. Tonight. My house. Not here.”

Mhairi was silent for a long moment. Ewan Boyd was the party’s senior strategist, a cynical wizard of data and demographics. Isla Currie was the Finance Secretary, sharp, pragmatic, and possessed of a moral compass that could magnetise steel. The inner cabinet.

“This sounds like a plot,” she said quietly.

“It’s a conversation.”

“Plot. Conspiracy. Conversation. The semantics get blurry when you start excluding the Deputy First Minister and the Cabinet Secretary for Justice.” She sighed, reading his unyielding expression. “Fine. Your house. Nine o’clock. I’ll bring the whisky. You’ll need it.”

---

The house in the Grange was a detached Victorian villa, bought with the proceeds of his previous life as a history professor. It was too big for him now, since Anna had gone. The silence of it echoed. He often worked in the kitchen, the Aga’s solid heat a bulwark against the empty rooms above.

By nine, the four of them were seated around the scrubbed pine table. A bottle of Lagavulin stood open between them, a ceremonial object. Ewan Boyd, small, restless, with the eyes of a hungry kestrel, was already scrolling through polling on his tablet. Isla Currie sat perfectly still, her hands folded on the table, watching MacAulay. She was a woman who believed in preparation.

“Right,” Mhairi said, pouring drams. “The secret society is convened. The agenda, First Minister?”

MacAulay stood, leaning against the Aga. “The end of the road. Thorne’s offer is the final offer. The devolution settlement is not a process; it’s a perimeter fence. We’ve reached it.”

Ewan didn’t look up from his tablet. “Our polling in key marginals shows ‘standing up for Scotland’ still tests twelve points higher than ‘working constructively with London.’ The pantomime, as you call it, is popular.”

“I’m not interested in what’s popular. I’m interested in what’s possible.”

“Then we’re in the realm of the possible,” Isla said, her voice cool. “Which is constrained by the Scotland Act, the Fiscal Framework, and the fact that we cannot run a deficit. We are administrators of a budget, not architects of an economy. That is the legal reality.”

“Laws,” MacAulay said, “are just stories that enough powerful people have agreed to believe. For a while.”

Now Ewan looked up. “Christ, Alistair. You sound like an anarchist. Or a first-year politics student after his first joint.”

“I sound like a historian. Laws change. Empires end. Stories lose their power.”

“What story do we have that’s more powerful than the Union?” Isla asked.

“We don’t have one. Yet.” He paced the length of the kitchen. “We keep fighting on their terms. Their laws, their budgets, their reviews. We need to change the terms. To shift the ground so fundamentally that their walls don’t just look ugly, they look *illegitimate*.”

Mhairi rubbed her temples. “You’re talking about a referendum. We don’t have the power to call one. And we’d lose. The numbers haven’t moved enough.”

“Not a referendum.” He stopped, facing them. “A confession.”

Silence.

Ewan broke it. “A what? Like, a sex scandal? Because I’m not sure that’s the ground you want to shift to.”

“A confession of truth. A Scottish Confession. Like 1560. Knox and the reformers didn’t ask permission from Mary of Guise to declare the old faith corrupt. They stood up and stated, clearly, what they believed to be true. They created a new reality by describing it with absolute conviction.”

Isla’s eyebrows were near her hairline. “You want to write a theological tract?”

“I want to write a political one. A document. Not a white paper—those are for bureaucrats. A declaration. A list of truths about Scotland’s place in the Union that are so self-evident, so morally undeniable, that to oppose them is to declare yourself an enemy of reason and justice.”

Ewan started to laugh, then saw MacAulay’s face and stopped. “You’re serious.”

“Deadly.”

“It’s a manifesto,” Mhairi said slowly. “A radical manifesto.”

“It’s more than that. It’s a weapon. We launch it not as a government document, but as a people’s document. We get signatories. Not just politicians. Poets, scientists, doctors, trade unionists, entrepreneurs, nurses. A civic coalition that transcends party. We force every institution, every public figure, to either sign it or reject it. We force the issue out of the Holyrood corridors and into the living rooms, the pubs, the churches.”

Isla was nodding, but it was the nod of dissection, not agreement. “The content. What are these self-evident truths?”

“That the Union exists for the benefit of the British state, not the Scottish people. That our parliament is a sham democracy, its powers contingent on the goodwill of our political opponents. That our resources have been systematically plundered for centuries. That the very structure of the UK is designed to prevent a nation like Scotland from achieving its potential. That this is not a partnership, but a possession.”

The room was cold, despite the Aga’s glow.

“It’s secessionist,” Ewan stated.

“It’s factual,” MacAulay countered. “We present evidence. Economic data, historical analysis, legal opinion. We make it unanswerable. We paint a picture of a relationship that is, by its nature, corrupt. Not corrupt with brown envelopes, but corrupt in its foundation. A power imbalance so severe it constitutes a moral crime.”

Mhairi had her eyes closed. “The press will call it a declaration of war.”

“Good. War is honest. This cold peace is a lie.”

Isla leaned forward. “The immediate consequences would be catastrophic. Thorne would suspend the Parliament. He’d have the legal cover. Section 30 of the Scotland Act gives him the power to intervene if devolution is ‘a threat to the economic or constitutional integrity of the UK.’ Calling the Union a corrupt possession would qualify.”

“Let him.”

“Let him?” Ewan exploded. “He’d send in the Scotland Office to run everything! We’d be back to direct rule! All our work, gone!”

“And the people would see it,” MacAulay said, his voice low and intense. “They’d see the mask come off. The polite fiction of partnership torn away. It would be the ’79 moment, but a hundred times worse for them. When they killed the first parliament, it was with a whimper—a failed referendum. This would be a roar, and they’d answer it with a hammer. And the world would see. Europe would see. The hammer makes the best propaganda.”

The silence that followed was thick, charged. Mhairi opened her eyes. They were full of a terrible understanding. “You’re not trying to win a negotiation, Alistair. You’re trying to blow up the negotiating table. You’re forcing a crisis so deep that the only outcomes are independence or dictatorship.”

“Yes.”

“And you’re willing to lose everything? Your position? The party? The parliament?”

He met her gaze. “What am I preserving, Mhairi? A title? The right to manage poverty while asking for permission to build a school? I didn’t come here to be a clerk.”

Ewan threw his hands up. “The party will never follow you. The moderates will split. We’ll be destroyed.”

“Then we’ll be destroyed on our feet, fighting for something real, not on our knees, begging for less.”

Isla had been watching him, analytical, detached. Now she spoke. “The document. It would need to be flawless. Legally watertight, economically irrefutable, historically unimpeachable. A single error, a single exaggeration, and it becomes a laughing stock. It would need… an author of immense credibility. Not a politician.”

“We’ll get one. A committee. The best minds we have, in secret.”

“And the launch?”

“A national event. Simultaneous publications in every newspaper. A speech, not in parliament, but somewhere… symbolic. The Assembly Hall on the Mound. Where the Kirk met. Where the *original* Confession was debated.”

Mhairi poured herself another dram, her hand steady. “This is madness, Alistair.”

“It’s the only thing that isn’t mad anymore.” He looked at each of them. “I’m going to do this. With or without you. I’d rather it was with.”

Ewan stared into his whisky. “I need to run the numbers. On party support. On public reaction. It’s… it’s a suicide pill.”

“It’s a lifeline,” MacAulay said. “Thrown into a sea of lies.”

Isla stood up. “I’ll draw up a list. Of economists, constitutional lawyers, historians. People who are beyond reproach, and who might… sympathise. Discreetly.” She was already moving from the abstract to the practical. It was her gift.

Mhairi finally nodded, a slow, weary capitulation to the inevitable. “I’ll start working on the narrative *around* the narrative. The ‘why now.’ The moral imperative. We’ll need a name. Something that isn’t ‘The MacAulay Manifesto.’”

“*The Edinburgh Declaration*,” Isla suggested.

“Too vague,” Ewan muttered, still staring at his tablet as if it could save him. “*The Case for Scotland*.”

“*A Confession of Truth*,” MacAulay said. The words hung in the air, solemn, archaic, dangerous.

“*A Scottish Confession*,” Mhairi echoed. “They’ll know what it echoes. The religious weight. The finality.”

“Good,” MacAulay said. The stone was in his hand now. He could feel its edges. “That’s what we need. Finality.”

As they filed out into the Edinburgh night, each carrying the weight of the conspiracy, MacAulay remained in the kitchen. He took the bottle and poured the last of the Lagavulin. He didn’t drink it. He just watched the liquid, the colour of old amber, catching the light.

He thought of John Knox, a man of furious, uncompromising certainty. A man who changed a nation’s soul with the power of an idea, declared without flinching.

He was no Knox. He was a weary politician with a history degree and a diminishing store of hope.

But he had the idea. And tonight, he had begun.

The fire was lit.

# Chapter 3

## **CHAPTER 3**

The room had no windows. It was in the basement of a university library, a former storage area for microfiche, now repurposed with a long table, a dozen chairs, and a pervasive smell of damp paper and dust. The “Scriptorium,” Mhairi had christened it, without irony. Here, the new confession would be forged.

Alistair MacAulay looked at the six people seated around the table. They were the “Sympathisers.” Isla’s list, vetted by a paranoia that was now their standard operating procedure. No civil servants. No party apparatchiks. Just minds.

Professor Elspeth Murray, constitutional historian, small and bird-like with a gaze that could etch glass. Dr. Rajiv Singh, economist from the business school, young, brilliant, with a reputation for tearing orthodoxies apart with spreadsheets. Father Michael Kerrigan, a Catholic priest and moral philosopher, his presence a deliberate bridge across Scotland’s old sectarian divide. Morag Paterson, a retired judge, her face a map of stern impartiality. Jamie Douglas, a celebrated poet, who said little but saw everything. And Kirsty Fleming, head of the largest trade union, her arms folded, her expression one of profound scepticism.

“Thank you for coming,” MacAulay began, dispensing with titles. “You know why you’re here. You’ve seen the preliminary brief. You know the stakes. Secrecy is absolute. What is discussed in this room does not leave it. If that’s unacceptable to anyone, now is the time to leave.”

No one moved. Father Kerrigan steepled his fingers. “You’re asking us to draft a document that will be, in effect, a declaration of political war. Under conditions of… academic collaboration.”

“I’m asking you to describe reality,” MacAulay said. “Without the filters of diplomacy or fear. To build an irrefutable case, fact by fact, that the current constitutional arrangement is morally and politically untenable.”

“A prosecutor’s brief,” Morag Paterson said, her voice like a judge’s summing up. “Against the State of the United Kingdom.”

“Yes.”

Rajiv Singh tapped his pen on the table. “The economic section will be key. The ‘subsidy junkie’ narrative is their strongest weapon. We need to dismantle it, not with rhetoric, but with GERS figures turned inside out. Show the net outflow. The resource curse. The managed dependency.”

“Precisely,” MacAulay said. “Elspeth, the historical precedent?”

Professor Murray adjusted her glasses. “The ’79 assembly had a ‘Claim of Right.’ It was a moral argument. This must be more. It must be a *forensic* indictment. We can draw on the ’89 Claim too, but the language must be contemporary. Unflinching. We are not claiming a right; we are stating a wrong.”

Jamie Douglas spoke, his voice soft but clear. “It must also sing. In places. Data is bloodless. It must have a pulse. A sense of… betrayed promise.”

Kirsty Fleming unfolded her arms. “Aye, and it must mean something to the woman on the checkout at Tesco, or the welder in the yard at Rosyth. It can’t be a professor’s pamphlet.”

“That’s why you’re here, Kirsty,” Mhairi said from the corner where she was taking notes. “And Jamie. To give it soul and sinew.”

Father Kerrigan looked at MacAulay. “The moral framework. You use the word ‘corruption.’ Not of individuals, but of the structure itself. This is a serious theological and ethical charge. It implies a sinfulness that is systemic. Can you prove sin?”

“Can you prove that treating a nation as a subsidiary, stripping its assets while infantilising its government, is anything but a sin against the common good?” MacAulay countered.

A faint smile touched the priest’s lips. “I believe I can.”

“Then that’s your section.”

They worked for three hours, dividing the labour, arguing over phrasing, sourcing claims. MacAulay felt a strange, electric hope. This was not politics. This was scholarship with a destination. It was the Enlightenment ideal: reason applied to power.

His phone, set to silent, buzzed on the table. He ignored it. It buzzed again. And again. A triple signal. The emergency pattern.

He excused himself and stepped into the barren corridor outside.

It was Ewan. “You need to come. Now. To the office. It’s hit the fan.”

“What has?”

“The *Courier*. Tomorrow’s front page. They’ve got a leak. Not the confession. Something else.”

MacAulay’s blood went cold. “What?”

“It’s about the Lochside development. The green energy park.”

“What about it?”

“The land purchase. The company that sold it to the government agency. It’s a shell. Registered in the Caymans. The beneficial owner…” Ewan’s voice was tight. “It’s your brother-in-law. Or was. Before he died.”

MacAulay’s mind reeled. Anna’s brother, Calum. A charming, feckless property developer. Dead two years in a car crash. “Calum didn’t own anything in the Caymans. He was bankrupt.”

“The shell company was set up six months *after* he died. But the paper trail is a mess. And the *Courier* is implying the land was sold to the government at three times its value, and the money was funneled offshore. They’re not naming you. Yet. But they’re asking who approved the purchase.”

MacAulay leaned against the cold wall. The Lochside project. A flagship green initiative. He’d championed it. The final sign-off had come to his desk. He’d signed it, one of a hundred papers that day. The due diligence was done by the agency. It was clean.

But Calum’s name, even posthumously, attached to it? Anna’s brother?

“It’s a set-up,” he whispered.

“Of course it’s a fucking set-up!” Ewan hissed. “But it’s a brilliant one. It’s not a direct accusation. It’s a cloud of poison. ‘Questions being asked.’ ‘First Minister’s family link.’ ‘Mystery offshore payment.’ It doesn’t have to be true. It just has to stick long enough to drown out everything else. They must have got a whisper. About something. About us moving. This is the counter-strike.”

The timing was too perfect. The confession was barely an embryo, and already the forces of reaction were moving, not with a hammer, but with a needle, aiming to inject a slow, paralyzing venom.

“I’m on my way.”

He walked back into the Scriptorium. The debate had paused. They all looked at him.

“We have to stop for today,” he said, his voice strangely calm. “A… political complication has arisen.”

Professor Murray peered at him. “Is it serious?”

“It’s a piece of dirt. They’re throwing it to see if it blinds us.” He looked at their faces, these brilliant, cautious people who had agreed to step into the shadows with him. “This is what they do. This is the nature of the power we’re describing. It doesn’t debate; it smears. It doesn’t argue; it corrupts. Even the accusation of corruption is a form of corruption.”

Father Kerrigan nodded slowly. “The first taste of the cross.”

“We go on,” MacAulay said, more firmly than he felt. “We meet again, same time, two days from now. The work is more important than ever.”

As they gathered their things, a sombre mood had replaced the earlier intellectual fervour. The abstract had become concrete. The risk had a name, and a face, and a front page.

Mhairi drove him back to Holyrood. The city was beautiful in the late afternoon light, but it felt like a set now, a stage where a trap was being laid.

“We need to get ahead of it,” she said. “Issue a statement. Full transparency. Release all the documents on the land deal.”

“And look defensive. Guilty. The press will say ‘The lady doth protest too much.’” He stared out the window. “Anna will be devastated. She loved Calum, despite everything. To have his name dragged through this…”

“We’ll handle it.” But her knuckles were white on the steering wheel.

In his office, Ewan and Isla were waiting. The draft front page was on his desk, a PDF from a mole at the *Courier*. The headline: **LOCHSIDE ‘GREEN GOLD’ MYSTERY: OFFSHORE LINK TO FM’S FAMILY.** The article was a masterpiece of innuendo.

“The source?” MacAulay asked.

“Anonymous tip to the political editor. With documents. The Caymans stuff is real. The link to Calum is… speculative, but plausible enough to print.”

“Cathcart,” MacAulay said. “Or someone in his garden. This has Whitehall’s fingerprints. It’s too neat.”

“We can’t prove that,” Isla said. “What we can do is audit every line of the deal. Publicly. Appoint an independent judge to review it.”

“And while that judge is reviewing, the cloud hangs over us. The Confession becomes ‘the desperate gambit of a tainted First Minister.’ They’ll tie the two together. A corruption scandal and a radical break. They’ll paint us as both crooked and crazy.”

The room fell silent. The high-minded project of the Scriptorium seemed naive, suddenly. A child’s drawing against the gritty, grimy reality of realpolitik.

MacAulay walked to the window. The castle was lit up, a fairy-tale illusion against the darkening sky.

He had wanted a truth so bright it would burn through paper walls.

They had responded with mud. Simple, effective, blinding mud.

The stone was still in his hand. But the ground had turned to quicksand.

He turned back to them. “We proceed. With the Confession. And with the audit. We do both. We walk the two roads. One of light. One of… cleaning out the stables

## **CHAPTER 4**

The road north was a grey ribbon laid over the sleeping bones of the land. It was not the soft, hedgerow-fringed artery of the south; this was a different beast, a scar of tarmac cutting through peat and rock, where the wind came off the mountains with a blade’s edge. MacAulay watched it from the back of the Range Rover, the castle’s fairy-tale illusion now sixty miles behind them. He was thinking not of stones, but of peat. How you cut it, and it dried, and it burned with a slow, acrid smoke that got into everything. A cleansing fire, they called it. It left nothing but a fine, grey ash.

“We should be in Inverness,” Ewan said from the passenger seat. His voice was tight, a violin string tuned too high. “Not on a bloody pilgrimage. The story’s breaking in twelve hours.”

Isla drove, her eyes fixed on the road unwinding in the headlights. “The story is a feint. The land is the truth. You fight the story in Inverness, you’re playing on their board, with their pieces. You find the truth on the ground, you own the board.”

“Philosophy,” Ewan snapped. “While they’re burning our house down with philosophy.”

“It’s not philosophy,” MacAulay said, his voice quiet. The car’s interior was a capsule of leather and low light, but outside the world was vast and ancient and black. “It’s topography. Cathcart understands the map of power. We need to understand the map of the land.”

They were going to Loch Dubh, the ‘Black Loch’ at the heart of the ‘Green Gold’ deal. Three hundred acres of marginal hill ground and a stretch of peaty water, sold by a struggling farmer to a community trust, facilitated by a Scottish Government grant. A good-news story, until the *Courier*’s documents showed the trust was a Russian doll of shell companies, the innermost one registered in a Caymanian lawyer’s filing cabinet. And a signature, on a letter of advice from the trust to the farmer, that bore a haunting resemblance to the wild, left-slanting scrawl of Calum MacAulay.

The rain here was Scottish rain. It came in sweeping, horizontal bursts, rattling against the side of the vehicle like handfuls of gravel.

“The farmer,” Isla said. “Donnie MacLeod. He’s agreed to talk. Said he’d meet us at the lochside. Said he hasn’t slept since the papers called him.”

“Guilt or fear?” Ewan asked.

“The two are often tenants in the same house,” MacAulay said.

He saw a light then, a single pinprick in the velvet darkness ahead, resolving into the yellow glow of a cottage window. Beyond it, a deeper blackness opened up—the void of the loch, swallowing the weak starlight. Isla slowed the car, the tyres crunching on a gravel track that led down towards the water. The air, when MacAulay opened the door, was cold and smelled of wet earth and decaying heather. The wind carried the sound of water lapping on stone, a weary, ancient rhythm.

A figure detached itself from the deeper shadow of a boathouse, a small man hunched inside a waxed jacket. Donnie MacLeod had a face carved by wind and worry, his eyes holding the wary exhaustion of a man who has spent a lifetime negotiating with weather and prices and now finds himself negotiating with ghosts.

“First Minister.” His voice was rough, the Gaelic lilt flattened by apprehension. He didn’t offer a hand. “I didnae think you’d come yourself.”

“The land is in my care, Mr. MacLeod. As are the people on it.”

A short, sharp nod. Donnie’s gaze flicked to Ewan and Isla, then back to the loch. “I sold it fair. I needed the money. The bank was at the door. The trust… they said it was for community benefit. A visitor centre. Ecological restoration. It sounded… clean.”

“And the man you dealt with?” MacAulay asked, his voice gentle, the tone he used in constituency surgeries for the bereaved.

“He came once. In a good car. A polite man. English, but not… not posh English. Efficient. He had all the papers. Said his name was Mr. Ellis. From the Cairn Trust.”

“Did he sign anything in front of you?”

“No. It was all done after. By post. Then the letter came, with the… the other signature. On the trust’s headed paper. Advising me to take the offer. It was different from his. I thought nothing of it. Just different folk in the same office.”

MacAulay felt the stone’s weight in his mind again. “Do you have it? The letter?”

Donnie fumbled in his jacket pocket, pulled out a plastic wallet, inside it a single sheet of paper, creased from folding. He handed it over, his fingers trembling slightly.

MacAulay took it. Isla shone her phone’s torch. The header was the Cairn Trust, an Edinburgh address. The wording was bland, professional. But the signature at the bottom…

It was like seeing a ghost’s handwriting. The defiant ‘C’ slashed like a scythe, the ‘l’ a leaning tower, the whole thing rushing downhill as if the words couldn’t wait to be done. Calum’s hand. Not a perfect forgery—a shade too controlled, the panic that fuelled his brother’s penmanship replaced by a cold precision—but a damn good one. Good enough for a headline. Good enough to plant a seed of poison in the public mind, and in Anna’s heart.

“He’s been gone five years,” Donnie said, a plea in his voice. “I didnae connect it. Not until the journalist said the name. I wouldnae have… I liked Calum. He was troubled, but he had a good heart when the wind was in the right direction.”

“I know,” MacAulay said, folding the paper away. It felt unclean in his hand. “This isn’t your doing, Donnie.”

“Whose is it, then?” The farmer’s fear was curdling into a desperate anger. “Because they’re at my door now. The press. Men in suits from London asking questions in the pub. My phone rings with numbers I don’t know. This is my home. It’s quiet here. Or it was.”

“It’s my doing,” MacAulay said, the words leaving him with a strange relief. “For wanting a different country. And for having a brother who left a trail of chaos. The two have been… conflated.”

He looked past Donnie, to the black water. The loch was a mirror to nothing, a hole in the world. This was the edge of the territory. Not Cathcart’s, not Whitehall’s, but the territory of the thing they had built: a weaponised past, a manufactured scandal in a quiet place. The conflict was here, in this damp, lonely dark.

“What do I do?” Donnie asked.

“You tell the truth,” Isla said. “To the judge we appoint. To anyone who asks. You sold your land in good faith. That’s your armour.”

“Armour,” Donnie echoed, scoffing softly. “Words are poor armour against what’s coming.”

He turned and walked back towards the yellow light of his cottage, a man retreating to a last, besieged keep.

Back in the car, the heater blowing stale warmth, the tension turned inwards, a slow screw.

“We’re in the quicksand,” Ewan said, staring at the PDF of the letter on his tablet, its glow painting his face a sickly blue. “They’ve given us a forgery we can’t disprove without a body. They’ve linked a shady land deal to a dead addict who shares your name. The narrative is set. ‘First Minister’s family profits from secret deal.’ The audit just looks like panic. The Confession looks like a distraction.”

“So we don’t play the narrative game,” Isla said, her hands gripping the wheel as if she were still driving. “We change the game. We go deeper into the land. We find Ellis. We trace the shell companies back, not to Calum, but to whoever built them.”

“With what time?” Ewan’s laugh was a dry crack. “The *Courier* hits doorsteps at six a.m. By noon, the London packs will be howling for a statement. By tonight, the opposition will be calling for a vote of no confidence. This isn’t some subtle, long game, Isla. This is a blitzkrieg. They want us dead by the weekend.”

“Then we don’t give them a stationary target,” MacAulay said. He was still looking at the loch, a void in the window. “We split forces. You return to Inverness, Ewan. You handle the blitzkrieg. Issue the statement of full transparency. Announce the independent judge—get Professor MacKinnon from Edinburgh, she’s granite. Pre-empt the vote. Frame it as our demand for scrutiny.”

“And you?” Ewan asked, suspicion dawning.

“We follow the map,” MacAulay said, nodding to Isla. “The Cairn Trust’s Edinburgh address is a serviced office. A dead end. But money leaves a trail, even through the Caymans. It has to enter and exit somewhere. A bank. A law firm. Ellis.”

“You’re the First Minister,” Ewan said, aghast. “You can’t go chasing shadows. It’s beneath the office. It’s… reckless.”

“The office is a suit of clothes, Ewan. Right now, it’s being used to dress a scarecrow. I need to move as a man, not a title.” He finally turned from the window. The quiet in the car was total, filled only with the sigh of the wind and the distant, accusing lap of water. “You hold the line with the tools of the state. We will hunt with the tools of the ground. Two roads.”

It was the plan, born not in a bright room of strategy, but in the damp, dark pressure of the lochside. A plan of division, of acknowledged weakness. It felt less like a strategy and more like a confession of its own: *We cannot win on one field, so we must fight on two, and hope one holds.*

Ewan was silent for a long minute. Then he gave a single, resigned nod. “I’ll need full deniability. If you’re caught digging in the dirt…”

“You’ve never heard of it,” Isla finished.

They dropped Ewan at the nearest town, a clutch of grey stone buildings around a single crossroads, where a government car would collect him. The transfer was wordless, a grim passing of the baton. As their taillights receded, Ewan stood under a sodium streetlamp, a figure already isolated, holding the bag of respectable warfare.

MacAulay and Isla drove east, towards the dawn that was still hours away. They found a room in a fishing hotel on the coast, a place of brown carpets and faded tartan, smelling of old tobacco and fried breakfasts. The proprietor asked no questions, his eyes glazed with the late hour and a lifetime of seeing strangers come and go.

The room had two narrow beds and a window overlooking a small, shingle beach. The North Sea beyond was an invisible roar in the dark.

“Get some sleep,” Isla said, her voice stripped of its usual steel, leaving only fatigue. “We start at first light. I have a contact. A disgruntled ex-compliance officer for one of the fancy offshore firms. He hates the whole system. He might talk, for the right cause and the right price.”

“The Scriptorium’s funds?” MacAulay asked, sitting on the edge of the stiff bed.

“A different budget. One with fewer lines of accountability.”

He nodded. The high-minded project was now funding espionage against its enemies. The corruption was not just something they fought; it was a medium they now moved through, a mud they had to wallow in to find footing.

Isla used the bathroom, the sound of water running. MacAulay remained on the bed, still in his coat. He felt the weariness in his bones, a cold sediment settling. He thought of Anna, asleep in their Edinburgh flat, oblivious for a few more hours to the new ghost of her brother-in-law being paraded in the press. He thought of Calum—not the addict, the ruin, but the boy. Running ahead of him on the beach at Luskentyre, shouting into the wind, a creature of pure, untamed energy. He had thrown stones then, too, aiming for the horizon, believing he could reach it.

The corruption of power, he saw now, was not always a grand, theatrical rot. Sometimes it was this: the slow, insidious bending of things. The bending of truth into plausible deniability. The bending of a brother’s tragic legacy into a political cudgel. The bending of your own principles until you sat in a cheap hotel room, planning covert operations with state funds, because the light you wanted to shine was too easily smothered by the mud they threw.

He had wanted to speak a truth that would change the weather of the nation.
They had simply changed the weather on *him*. A manufactured storm, designed to drown out his voice.

Isla came out, her face bare, looking younger and harder. “You should sleep.”

“In a moment.”

She studied him, then sat on the other bed, facing him. “We can still turn back. Let Ewan fight the political battle. Lose cleanly, if we have to lose. Protect your family’s name, at least.”

“And the Confession?”

“It dies. Maybe it was always a fantasy. A state is not a monastery. Power is not purified by declaration. It’s just… power.”

He looked at her. Isla, the true believer, offering him the exit ramp. The final surrender. It would be easy. To lay down the stone. To let the quicksand take him. There was a dignity in it, even.

He saw Donnie MacLeod’s terrified eyes. He saw the loch, black and swallowing. He saw the forged signature, a serpentine whisper from the grave.

“No,” he said, the word quiet but absolute. “We proceed. We walk the two roads. One of light. One of cleaning out the stables.” He almost smiled, a thin, cold thing. “Even if we get covered in shit doing it.”

Isla held his gaze for a long moment, then nodded, a soldier’s acceptance. She lay down, turning her back, and was still.

MacAulay stood and went to the window. He could see nothing but his own reflection, a pale ghost superimposed on the blackness. Beyond the glass, the sea roared its endless, indifferent song. The dawn, when it came, would be grey and slow.

He had his plan. Flawed, desperate, bifurcated. A political defence and a covert hunt. A confession and an audit.

And he had his moment of quiet, here in the humming silence of the cheap room, with the exhausted sleep of his lieutenant behind him and the vast, uncaring dark ahead.

His inner demon was not fear of failure, or even of scandal. It was the chilling knowledge that to fight the rot, you had to touch it. To grasp the tool that would dig out the poison, you had to get its filth on your hands. The corruption was not just out there, in Whitehall’s polished schemes. It was in the choice itself. In the compromise of the clean fight. The demon whispered that there *was* no clean fight, that his Scriptorium was a child’s dream, and that the only language power understood was the one he was now reluctantly learning to speak: the language of secrets, of dirt, of counter-ambush.

He pressed his forehead against the cold glass. The reflection’s eyes met his own.

*You wanted a truth so bright*, the demon murmured, its voice his own. *But truth is a stone. And sometimes you have to throw it.*

Outside, the first faint bruise of light appeared on the horizon. Not a dawn, but the beginning of one. The hook was in him now, deep. Not the hook of the next political move, but the hook of the hunt. Somewhere out there was a man named Ellis. A signature. A trail. A truth, not bright, but buried. And he would dig for it, with dirty hands, into the coming day.

# Chapter 5

## **CHAPTER 5**

The dawn was not grey and slow. It was a violent, surgical incision, a blade of pale light slicing the horizon and bleeding colour back into the world. It exposed the room for what it was: a worn, sad box smelling of damp carpet and stale silence. Isla was already up, her movements efficient, her face a closed door. The soldier had replaced the confidante. MacAulay watched her from the chair where he had spent the remaining dark hours, not sleeping, but mapping the contours of the trap he was about to spring on himself.

“The statement is drafted,” she said, not looking up from her screen. Her voice was gravel, scraped raw by exhaustion and resolve. “A masterclass in contrition and deflection. It expresses your profound disappointment, your full cooperation with the Cabinet Office audit, your commitment to the transparency the Scottish people deserve. It will play well in Edinburgh. It will be seen as weakness in London.”

“It is weakness,” MacAulay said, his own voice flat. “A strategic one. The confession to the lesser sin.” He stood, his joints protesting. The reflection in the window was gone, replaced by the hard truth of a choppy, gunmetal sea. “And the other road?”

Isla finally looked at him. “The trail is colder than a grave. Ellis, Peter. Last known employment, a sub-contracted archival service used by three Whitehall departments between 2004 and 2009. Service dissolved. No forwarding. The signature on the Scriptorium funding order is a ghost.”

“Ghosts can be raised,” MacAulay said. “If you know the right incantation. Or apply the right pressure.” He turned from the window. “We proceed. Both roads. You will handle the public penitence. I will handle the hunt.”

“Alone?”

“You’ll be busy being my loyal, shocked chief of staff. The one managing the ‘crisis’. It has to be clean. Separate.”

She didn’t like it. Her jaw tightened, a tiny fracture in her composure. “The dirt. You’re going into it alone.”

“That was always the point of the second road, Isla. To keep the filth contained.” He picked up his coat, a cheap, anonymous thing bought from a charity shop in Kirkcaldy. It felt lighter than his own, and heavier all at once. “The car will take you back to Edinburgh. I have a train to catch.”

“Where?”

“The only place a ghost leaves a shadow,” he said. “The place where the paperwork was born.”

***

The train south was a different beast to the Ministerial car. It was all hard plastic, shouted phone conversations, and the sweet, cloying smell of warmed-up pastry. MacAulay sat by the window, a man in a crowd, invisible. He watched the Scottish borders give way to the flat, hedgerowed vastness of the north of England. The rain here was different again. Not the soft London drizzle, nor the driving horizontal spite of the east coast. It was a steady, industrial rain, blanketing the fields in a wet wool monotony.

He was thinking of drystane dykes. Of how you chose a stone. Not the perfect, handsome one, but the one with the right heft, the right angle to lock into the gap and bear the weight of its neighbours. Politics was supposed to be like that. A patient architecture. What he was doing now was not building. It was digging. Archaeology in a midden.

He got off at Doncaster, a place of concrete and glass under the weeping sky. The archival service’s last registered address was a unit on an industrial estate that smelled of diesel and rust. It was now a printer cartridge wholesaler. A bored young man with a lip ring knew nothing. MacAulay stood in the rain outside, the water finding its way down his collar. A dead end, smelling of ink and futility.

But ghosts needed paymasters. They needed systems. He used a public library computer, its keyboard sticky with use, and followed a darker thread. The sub-contractor had been used by the Home Office, Justice, and the Cabinet Office itself. A procurement triangulation. He cross-referenced names from old, buried committee reports, the dry minutes where the real decisions were often hidden in the passive voice. *It was agreed that external resource would be engaged.*

One name surfaced, again and again, as a chair or a rapporteur. Sir Gareth Pike. A civil service mandarin of the old school, retired now. A man who, according to a society page in a local newspaper he found, was giving a talk on ‘The Challenges of Modern Governance’ to the Harrogate Historical Society that very evening.

MacAulay’s smile was thin, and without warmth. A public talk. A man in the light. It was an opportunity, or a beautifully baited trap. He felt the hook in him twist.

***

The Harrogate Historical Society met in a room above a pub that smelled of old beer and older carpets. It was a gathering of twenty or so polite, attentive faces, mostly elderly, beneath a flickering fluorescent strip. Sir Gareth Pike stood at a modest lectern, a picture of benign erudition. He was in his seventies, trim, with a well-kept silver moustache and eyes that crinkled at the corners when he made a mild, self-deprecating joke. He spoke of efficiency drives, of digital transformation, of the delicate balance between accountability and delivery. It was smooth, empty, and utterly convincing.

MacAulay sat at the back, in the shadows. He did not listen to the words. He listened to the music beneath them—the practised cadence of a man who had spent a lifetime making the exercise of power sound reasonable, inevitable, and clean. This was the language he had once aspired to master. Now it sounded like a foreign tongue, a beautiful, complex lie.

The applause was gentle. Pike took questions about data security, about the loss of institutional memory. He answered with avuncular patience. As the crowd began to disperse for tea and biscuits, MacAulay moved. He intercepted Pike as the man collected his notes.

“Sir Gareth. A fascinating talk.”
Pike looked up, the polite, slightly distant smile already in place. “Thank you. You’re new to our group?”
“In a manner of speaking. I’m interested in a specific point of institutional memory. The use of sub-contracted archival services in the mid-2000s. Particularly a firm called ‘Chronicle Solutions’.”
The smile did not falter, but the crinkles around the eyes smoothed out, as if ironed. The eyes themselves, a pale blue, became very still. “Good heavens. That’s very specific. And rather before my time, I’m afraid.”
“Your name is on the oversight committee minutes. July 2004. February 2007.”
A beat of silence. The hum of the fluorescent light seemed to grow louder. “You have done your homework, Mr…?”
“MacAulay. Alistair MacAulay.”
The name landed. Sir Gareth Pike did not startle. He did not pale. He simply… reconstituted himself. The avuncular historian vanished, and in his place stood, for just a second, the Permanent Secretary to the Home Office (2001-2008). It was in the straightening of the spine, the slight tilt of the head. A predator recognising another, of a different species.
“First Minister,” he said, his voice lower, devoid of its public warmth. “This is a surprise. I understood you were… managing a situation in Scotland.”
“The situation has branches. One of them leads here. To a ghost named Peter Ellis. He signed a document. I need to find him.”
Pike carefully slotted his papers into a leather folio. “A ghost, as you say. These temporary staff, they come and go. I’m afraid I can’t help you.” He made to move.
“The document authorised the funding of a project called the Scriptorium. A project that was then buried, and is now being used to bury me.”
Pike stopped. He looked at MacAulay with something akin to professional pity. “My dear fellow. You are digging in the wrong place. The Scriptorium was a pet project. A folly. It was closed because it was redundant. This is a political attack, plain and simple. You should be fighting it with politics, not chasing phantoms in retirement clubs.” The ‘my dear fellow’ was a masterstroke, a reassertion of seniority, a dismissal.
MacAulay felt the stone’s heft in his hand. The cold, certain weight. “Who does Ellis answer to now? Who paid for the silence?”
Pike’s face closed like a vault. “You are not in Scotland now, First Minister. You are on a different board. And you are playing a game whose rules you do not understand. I would advise you to go home. Tend to your garden. The weeds you are pulling here… their roots are deeper than you know. And they are connected.”
It was not a denial. It was a warning. A threat. A confirmation.
“Is that a confession, Sir Gareth?”
“It is a lesson,” Pike said softly. “From one who has seen the machinery. You think corruption is a tumour you can cut out. It is not. It is the grease in the gears. It is the necessary fiction that allows the heavy, clumsy business of state to function. You wanted a truth so bright? The truth is, your Scriptorium was a threat to the fiction. It was cleaned away. As all threats are. Now, if you’ll excuse me.”
He walked away, a dignified, unhurried pace, towards the tea urn. He did not look back.
MacAulay stood alone, the polite chatter of the historical society washing around him. He had touched the rot. He had felt its cold, slick texture. And it had spoken to him in the reasonable, regretful tones of a knight of the realm. *The necessary fiction.* The hook was in him deep now, barbed and tearing. He had come for a name and been given a philosophy. A justification. It was far more terrifying.

***

The cheap hotel room in Harrogate was a clone of the one in Fife, a testament to a certain globalised despair. Isla had texted: *Statement delivered. Storm is breaking. Media savage. Party HQ demanding your head. Where are you?*
He did not reply. He sat on the edge of the bed, the confrontation with Pike replaying in his mind. *The necessary fiction.* The man hadn’t even been afraid. He had been *disappointed*, like a tutor watching a promising pupil fixate on a trivial error.
His mobile rang, a private number. He answered.
“First Minister.” The voice was Sir Jeremy Cathcart’s, the Permanent Secretary. The polished neutrality was still there, but beneath it, MacAulay heard a new frequency: a faint, icy triumph. “I trust you are well. Events are moving quickly. The Prime Minister has asked me to convey his… deep concern. The audit team will be in Edinburgh tomorrow. Full access. It would be best if you made yourself available.”
“I’m conducting government business, Jeremy.”
“Are you?” A pause, filled with the hum of secure lines. “It’s curious. Our security monitoring—purely routine, you understand—flagged an anomaly. Your official device is in Bute House. Yet a device linked to your personal account was recently used in a public library in Doncaster. And now it’s in Harrogate. Following up on a historical society event, of all things. Not exactly the business of the Scottish Government.”
MacAulay’s blood turned to silt. They were tracking him. Not just politically, but physically. The separation he had engineered was an illusion. The two roads were merging, and Whitehall was waiting at the junction.
“I’m entitled to a private life.”
“Of course. As is Sir Gareth Pike. A respected former public servant. It would be a shame if the… fervour of your current predicament led you to bother such people with baseless conspiracy theories. It could be seen as harassment. A sign of desperation. It would undermine what little credibility you have left.”
The message was clear. Stop digging. Or we will bury you with the dirt you uncover.
“Is that a threat, Sir Jeremy?”
“It is a *counsel*, First Minister. From a friend to the devolved administration. Go back to Edinburgh. Face the music. That is the only path now. The other road you seem to be contemplating… it leads nowhere good. For you, or for the Union we both cherish.”
The line went dead.
MacAulay lowered the phone. The room’s silence was no longer humming; it was a vacuum, sucking the air from his lungs. They knew. They had known every step. The trail to Ellis, the meeting with Pike—it had all been observed, allowed. He wasn’t hunting. He was being herded. The covert hunt was not his weapon; it was their pretext. The final nail. *Harassment of a retired civil servant. Paranoid behaviour. A man unfit for office.*
He saw the whole, elegant trap. The Scriptorium scandal was the anvil. His desperate, secret investigation would be the hammer that smashed him upon it. The corruption was not just in the act, but in the response it provoked. It forced you into the shadows, made you dirty, and then exposed you as dirty. It won in the light and in the dark.
This was his greatest fear, given form. Not failure, but complicity. Not defeat, but transformation. To fight the monster, he was becoming a thing of shadows and suspicion, and they would use that very transformation to destroy him. The clean fight was a myth. There was only the filth, and you were either covered in it, or you were the one applying it.
He looked at his hands. They were clean. But he felt the grime on them, sticky and indelible.
A profound despair, colder than the North Sea, settled in him. He had played the game on their board, by their rules. And he had lost. Isla was fighting a losing battle in Edinburgh. He was a tracked animal in England. Pike and Cathcart were not villains; they were functionaries, maintaining the fiction. And he was the inconvenient truth, being edited out.
He lay on the bed, staring at the cracked artex ceiling. The demon’s voice was not a whisper now; it was the only voice.
*You see? The stone is not for throwing. It is for weighing you down. For sinking you. The truth is not a weapon. It is a corpse. And you are its gravedigger.*
For hours, he did not move. The light from the window faded. The defeat was total. It was not a battle lost; it was the understanding that the war itself was a sham. The power he had sought to use for good was not a tool; it was an organism, and it rejected righteousness like a body rejects a foreign organ. He was the infection. And the white cells were closing in.

***

The darkness was absolute. In its depth, a memory surfaced, unbidden. Not of politics, but of his grandfather, a man who worked stone on the island of Lewis. He’d said, *When you hit a seam you cannae break, Alistair, you dinnae just hit harder. You find the weakness beside it. You change the angle of your strike. The dyke isnae just the stone in front of you. It’s the whole wall.*
The whole wall.
MacAulay sat up. The despair did not lift, but it crystallised into something harder. They were watching his every move. They expected the desperate politician, the cornered man lashing out, chasing ghosts. They had anticipated the covert hunt. They had *allowed* it.
So he would stop hunting.
He would stop being the First Minister chasing a conspiracy.
He would become something else.
He opened his laptop, not using his own accounts, but the basic, anonymous browsing function. He went not to government sites, or news archives, but to a public genealogy forum. He searched for ‘Peter Ellis’. A common name. He filtered by location, by age. He looked for the mundane, not the secret. Birth records, marriage notices, electoral roll snippets archived by enthusiastic amateurs.
It was tedious, mind-numbing work. A grain of sand sifted from a desert. But he was no longer looking for a spy, a conspirator. He was looking for a man. A man who had worked a temporary job in 2005. A man who would have a life before and after.
After two hours, his eyes burning, he found a fragment. A Peter Ellis, born 1972, listed as a ‘documentary archivist’ on the marriage certificate of a Jennifer Malloy in 2008 in Chester. The profession was right. The timeline was right.
He cross-referenced. Jennifer Malloy (now Ellis) appeared on a planning application objection in 2014 for a house in a village called Farndon, outside Chester. The objection was about the impact on a public footpath. It was signed *P. & J. Ellis, The Orchard, Farndon.*
An address.
It was nothing. It could be a different man. It could be a dead end. But it was not a Whitehall record. It was not a secret file. It was the debris of an ordinary life, left in the public domain because no one would ever think to look there for a ghost. Pike, Cathcart, the security services—they would be monitoring the dark web, the official channels, the movements of a First Minister. They would not be watching a genealogy forum for planning applications.
This was the weakness beside the seam. The angle of strike they had not anticipated. He was not digging in the midden of power. He was picking through the civilian litter left beside it.
He had no proof. He had an address. And he had a new understanding. The corruption’s weakness was its own arrogance, its focus on the high game. It forgot about the small, real lives it used as tools.
He packed his single bag. He left the hotel, paying in cash from a reserve he kept for emergencies. He walked to the railway station, not as a fugitive, but as a man with a destination. He bought a ticket to Chester. The train, when it came, was a local service, slow and stopping. He did not feel the hook in him now. He felt the heft of the stone. Not to throw, but to use. To break something open.

***

The Orchard was a modest 1930s semi-detached house with a pebble-dashed front and a neat, small garden. A child’s bicycle lay on its side on the path. It was raining again, that steady, English rain. MacAulay stood at the garden gate, a stranger in a cheap coat. All his political cunning, his rhetorical skill, was useless here. This was not a confrontation. It was an intrusion.
He walked to the door and knocked.
A woman answered, late forties, with a kind, tired face and her hair tied back. She held a tea towel. “Yes?”
“Mrs. Ellis? Jennifer Ellis?”
Her expression grew wary. “Yes?”
“My name is Alistair MacAulay. I need to speak to your husband, Peter. It’s about work he did a long time ago. For the government.”
Her face shut down completely. The warmth vanished. “He’s not here.”
“It’s very important. It’s not… I’m not here to cause trouble for him. I just need to understand something.”
“He’s not here,” she repeated, her voice firmer. She began to close the door.
From inside, a man’s voice called out, weary. “Who is it, Jen?”
“Nobody. Salesman.”
MacAulay spoke to the closing gap. “Mr. Ellis. My name is MacAulay. I’m the Scottish First Minister. The Scriptorium project. The signature. Please.”
There was a long silence. Then footsteps. Jennifer Ellis was gently moved aside, and a man appeared. He was in his early fifties, bespectacled, with the soft, rounded shoulders of someone who spent his life with books and boxes. He looked at MacAulay with the eyes of a man who had been waiting for this knock for fifteen years. There was fear in them, but also a profound, exhausted relief.
“Jen,” he said quietly, not looking away from MacAulay. “Put the kettle on. This’ll take a minute.”
They sat in a small, tidy living room filled with books and the faint smell of polish. Peter Ellis did not speak for a long time. He simply stared at his own hands, clasped in his lap.
“I knew someone would come,” he said finally, his voice barely above a whisper. “Not you. Someone else. From them.”
“Who are ‘they’, Peter?”
Ellis shook his head. “I don’t know names. I was a temp. A specialist. Palaeography, mainly. Medieval hands. They brought me in for a specific job. To authenticate and then process a batch of historical funding approvals. Back-dated. It was… unusual. But the money was good. And the man who hired me…”
“Sir Gareth Pike?”
Ellis flinched at the name, as if struck. “He was… convincing. Said it was a national security matter. A smoothing over of historical accounting for a sensitive cultural project. The Scriptorium. He said my signature, as the processing archivist, was a formality. A procedural ghost in the machine. That it would never see the light of day.” He looked up, his eyes desperate. “I needed the job. Jen was pregnant. We’d just bought this house.”
“And afterwards?”
“Afterwards, they paid me. A bonus. And they… suggested I take the expertise private. That the firm I worked for would be dissolved. That it was all part of the… clean-up. They were very polite. And very clear.” He swallowed. “I’ve been waiting ever since. For the other shoe to drop. When I saw the news about you… about the scandal… I knew. I knew it was that.”
MacAulay felt no triumph. Only a sickening pity. This was the human cost of the ‘necessary fiction’. A decent, frightened man in a pebble-dashed house, living with a ghost.
“Would you testify?” MacAulay asked, the words hollow even to him. “To what you just told me?”
Ellis let out a short, bleak laugh. “To what? That a knight of the realm asked me to sign a piece of paper? That I took a bonus? They’d destroy me. And you. They’d say I was a disgruntled ex-employee, that you coerced me. They’d tie you up in courts until you were dust.” He leaned forward. “Don’t you see? They’ve already won. The signature is real, but the story around it is whatever they say it is. They have the polish. We have the dirt. And dirt only stains the one who holds it.”
It was the same lesson, from a different source. The cleaner, the smaller man, understood the mechanism perfectly.
Jennifer Ellis came in with a tea tray. Her hands were shaking. She set it down. “You should go now, Mr. MacAulay. Please.”
MacAulay stood. He had his truth. It was not bright. It was small, sad, and utterly useless in a court of law or the court of public opinion. It was a stone, but it was a stone he could not throw without crushing the man in front of him.
He was at the door when Ellis spoke again.
“There is one thing.”
MacAulay turned.
“The bonus,” Ellis said. “It was paid into a building society account. A paper statement came, once. I was supposed to shred it. I… didn’t. I was scared. I wanted a record. In case.” He looked at his wife, who closed her eyes in resignation. “It’s in the attic. The account wasn’t in my name. It was in the name of a trust. The ‘Lycurgus Trust’. I looked it up back then. A shell. Registered in Jersey. But the paying signatory… it was a company. ‘Calton Strategies’.”
MacAulay committed the names to memory. “Thank you, Peter.”
“It won’t help,” Ellis said, his voice full of pity. “It’s just more ghosts. But… it’s yours now. The weight of it. You take it.”

***

The train north was a night train, slicing through the sleeping heart of England. MacAulay did not look out the window. He looked at his hands. They were still clean. But he had the weight now. The weight of a sad man’s confession, of a useless truth, of two names that were likely more fiction.
Yet, something had shifted. The despair was gone, burned away by a cold, clear fury. He had faced the mechanism of his defeat—the way corruption turned your own integrity against you—and he had not broken. He had found a different angle. He had not found a weapon, but he had found a lens. A way to see the machinery.
The Lycurgus Trust. Calton Strategies.
They were not answers. They were deeper questions. But they were *his* questions now. Not chased in a panic, but held with a grim, newfound patience. The fight was not clean. It was filthy. And he was now, irrevocably, a part of the filth. But he would not be the fiction. He would be the grit in its gears.
His phone buzzed. Isla. *Where the hell are you? The wolves are at the door. The party is having a vote of no confidence tomorrow. You need to be here.*
He typed a reply, his fingers steady. *I am on my way. Stall them. Tell them I have new information. Tell them I am following a credible lead.*
*Is it?* she replied instantly. *Credible?*
He thought of Peter Ellis’s tired, frightened eyes. *It’s human,* he typed. *That’s all. And it’s mine.*
He put the phone away. Outside, the black landscape flashed by, punctuated by the occasional lonely light of a farmhouse. The hook was still in him. But he was no longer the fish on the line. He was the fisherman, in a dark, polluted sea, and he had felt the first, faint tug on his own, makeshift line. The line was made of shame, and fear, and a planning application in Farndon. It was not strong. But it was real.
The demon was quiet now. In its place was a new voice, cold and quiet and his own.
*You wanted a truth so bright,* it said. *But truth is a stone. And sometimes you don’t throw it. Sometimes you use it to build. Something low. Something strong. Something in the dark, where they won’t think to look.*
The train rushed on, carrying him and his dirty, useless stone towards the gathering storm. He had his defeat. He had his names. And he had, for the first time, not a plan, but a direction.
Down.

# Chapter 6

## **CHAPTER 6**

The dawn that broke over Edinburgh was a grey, grudging thing. It did not illuminate the city so much as concede to its outlines, revealing the castle rock as a dark, brooding tooth against a gum of cloud. Alistair MacAulay stood at the window of his Bute House study, not watching the light grow, but the shadows solidify. He was thinking of the weight of the file in his locked drawer. Not a stone. A seed. A small, dry, poisonous seed.

The night had been a gauntlet of grim faces and sharper questions. The party’s National Executive, convened in a committee room that smelled of stale coffee and colder ambition, had not been wolves. Wolves had a pack loyalty, a clean hunger. These were rats in a sack, squealing and scratching, each trying to climb over the other to reach the diminishing air at the top. He had faced them with the calm of a man who has already swallowed the worst of the poison. He offered no grand defence. No soaring rhetoric. Only the flat, hard statement of a man following a lead.

“There are questions about the procurement process for the Caledonian Resilience Framework,” he’d said, his voice a low burr in the panelled room. “Questions that lead to London. To entities with no face and a great deal of reach. I am following them.”

“Is it the Treasury?” a voice had demanded. “Is it the Cabinet Office? Give us a name, for God’s sake, Alistair.”

“I have names,” he’d replied, meeting the man’s eyes. “But they are not answers. They are deeper questions. And until I understand the question, the name is just a noise.”

It had been enough. Just. The vote of no confidence had been shelved, not discarded. A stay of execution, not a pardon. They had been cowed not by his certainty, but by the unfamiliar terrain of his quiet. He was no longer the fiery evangelist of transparency. He was something quieter, denser. A man with a compass pointing straight down.

The door opened behind him without a knock. Only two people did that. Isla, his chief of staff, whose heels usually announced her like a volley of warning shots. And this one.

“You look like hell,” said Mhairi Sinclair, dropping into the wingback chair by the dead fireplace. She was his oldest friend in politics, possibly his only friend. A backbencher with the conscience of a martyr and the tactical sense of a chess grandmaster who had long ago grown bored of the board. She wore her fifty-odd years like a comfortable jacket, her grey hair a wild, wiry frame for a face that was all intelligent angles.

“It’s the light,” MacAulay said, not turning. “It’s an English sort of grey. It doesn’t suit the stone.”

“Bollocks to the light. You’ve got something. I could smell it on you last night. It’s not hope. It’s colder.”

He finally turned from the window. The room felt too large, too formal. A stage set for a better man. “I have a file. From a planning officer in Farndon. Peter Ellis.”

“The one who jumped?”

“The one who was pushed. Gently. Over years.” He walked to the desk, unlocked the drawer, and placed the thin folder between them on the leather blotter. It looked insignificant. A sheaf of photocopies and handwritten notes. “He gave me the lens. This is what I saw through it.”

Mhairi did not reach for it. She looked at it as if it were a sleeping scorpion. “The Lycurgus Trust.”

“You know it?”

“I know of it. A philanthropic fund. Arts, conservation, vague constitutional ‘bridge-building’. Dull as ditchwater and twice as deep. Donors anonymous. Trustees a roll-call of the discreetly eminent.”

“It purchased a derelict farmhouse and twelve acres of scrubland north of Farndon, for three times the market value, six months before the route for the high-speed rail spur was confirmed. The spur that will require a major logistics depot. The land is now worth approximately one hundred and seventeen times what Lycurgus paid.”

Mhairi let out a slow breath, a soft whistle. “Inside knowledge. Nasty, but not novel. So a charity is a front for property speculation. That’s a story for the financial pages, not the end of your premiership.”

“The vendor was a company registered in Jersey. Calton Strategies acted as the legal facilitator. Calton’s other major client, at that time, was the UK Department for Union Affairs, which was chairing the cross-border transport committee that selected the route.”

The silence in the room changed texture. It became a held breath.

“A circle,” Mhairi said, very quietly. “A perfect, closed circle. The UK government uses a secretive fund to buy land its own decision will enrich, using a firm that works for both sides. Profits are privatised. Policy is neutralised. And anyone looking sees only a lucky charity and a defunct farm.”

“It’s a mechanism,” MacAulay said. “One cog. A small one. But it proves the machine exists. It turns policy into private equity. It makes a mockery of every debate we have, every vote we take. It turns sovereignty into a spreadsheet function.”

Mhairi finally picked up the file. She did not open it. She weighed it in her hand. “This is your stone.”

“It’s not for throwing. It’s for building. Something low. In the dark.”

“What, exactly?”

“A parallel track. Isla is already working on it. We use the Scottish National Investment Bank. We create a new, opaque vehicle. A ‘Civic Infrastructure Fund’. We seed it with a few million of our own money, then we go to the markets. We make it attractive, boring, profitable. And then we use it to do what they do. To buy land, to influence planning, to get inside the machine.”

Mhairi stared at him. Her expression was not shock, but a profound, weary recognition. “You want to fight corruption by becoming corrupt.”

“I want to understand the language they speak. It’s not ideology. It’s capital. It’s leverage. I want to learn it. Then I want to use it to sabotage the sentence they are writing for this country.”

“And when you’re inside, Alistair? How do you stay clean?”

“I’m not clean,” he said, the words flat and final. “I am part of the filth now. I accepted that on the train. But I will not be the fiction they want me to be. I will be the grit. I will be the irregularity in the data. The cost they didn’t forecast.”

She held his gaze for a long moment, then looked down at the file. “This is the tangible reward? This dirty little secret?”

“It’s the first tool. The only one we have.”

A ghost of a smile touched her lips. “Then let’s get to work.”

*

The next seventy-two hours were a fever dream of clandestine activity conducted in the plain sight of government. It felt less like administration and more like alchemy, turning the leaden bureaucracy of state into a covert instrument. Isla, her despair transformed into a fierce, focused energy, became the architect. Mhairi, the procurator of whispers and hidden alliances, became the scout.

They worked in the small, secure room off the Cabinet Secretariat, a space reserved for intelligence briefings. The air grew thick with the smell of strong coffee and dry marker pen. Flowcharts bloomed on whiteboards, were erased, bloomed again in more obscure patterns. Lawyers were consulted in hypotheticals. A trusted, discreet financier from Glasgow was brought in, a man who understood the poetry of offshore finance and asked no lyrical questions.

The “Civic Infrastructure Fund” (CIF) took shape. Its charter was a masterpiece of benign vagueness. Its proposed board was a carefully curated mix of the respectably dull and the quietly ruthless. MacAulay watched it coalesce with a strange detachment. He was building his own shadow. It was a horrifying, exhilarating act.

On the third evening, as a late, watery sun bled over the Firth of Forth, they had it. The structure was designed. The initial capital was earmarked from a dormant renewable energy fund. The prospectus was drafted. It was a thing of plausible deniability and profound duplicity.

Isla leaned back in her chair, the tendons in her neck tight as wires. “It’s done. The launch vehicle is built. It’s ugly, but it will fly.”

Mhairi poured three fingers of whisky into tumblers, passing them around. “To the grit in the gears,” she said, her voice hoarse with fatigue.

MacAulay took the glass. The amber liquid caught the dying light. It felt like a moment stolen from another life, a moment of victory. They had claimed their reward. Not a weapon, but a workshop. Not a truth, but a method. He allowed himself a single, deep sip, feeling the heat of it spread through the cold hollow that had taken residence in his chest. The demon was silent. The new, cold voice was quiet. There was only the hum of the strip light and the shared, exhausted breath of conspiracy.

It was Isla’s phone that shattered it. The buzz was violent on the wooden table. She glanced at the screen, her celebratory expression freezing, then cracking. She listened for ten seconds, said “I understand,” and hung up. The colour had drained from her face, leaving her freckles stark.

“Peter Ellis,” she said, the words like chips of ice. “They found him this morning. In a short-stay let in Leith. An overdose. Prescription painkillers and most of a bottle of vodka.”

The silence this time was absolute. The taste of whisky in MacAulay’s mouth turned to ash.

“Suicide?” Mhairi asked, the word too loud.

“That’s the preliminary report. No note. History of depression. A tragic end to a troubled life.” Isla’s voice was a monotone. “The press have it. The Scottish Tory leader is issuing a statement in an hour. ‘A time for reflection, not recrimination.’ ‘Did the First Minister’s reckless pursuit of conspiracy theories hound a vulnerable man to his death?’”

The hook in MacAulay’s flesh, the one he thought he now held the end of, twisted. A deep, sickening wrench. He saw Ellis’s tired eyes in the sterile hotel bar. *They don’t make threats. They make adjustments.*

“It’s not a suicide,” MacAulay said, his own voice sounding distant.

“We can’t prove that,” Isla snapped, panic fraying her edges. “All we have is a dead man and a file of circumstantial land deals. We look monstrous. We look like we killed him for a story that doesn’t exist.”

“It exists,” Mhairi said, but the fight had gone out of her tone.

“It exists *here*!” Isla gestured at the whiteboards, the closed files. “In this room! Out there, it’s a ghost. And now it’s a ghost that’s haunting a corpse. They’ve just made our first piece of grit into Exhibit A in our own trial.”

The celebration was not just cut short. It was annihilated. The reward had become a millstone before they had even lifted it. The consequence of the ordeal was not political pressure; it was moral quicksand. MacAulay put his untouched glass down. The weight of the file, of Ellis’s fear, of the man’s final, lonely terror, settled onto his shoulders. It was the true weight. He had thought he was carrying a secret. He was carrying a man’s life.

“We proceed,” he said, the words hollow.

“Alistair—” Isla began.

“We proceed,” he repeated, cutting her off. “Because stopping now makes his death meaningless. It makes it just… an adjustment. A successful one. We go darker. We go quieter. But we go.”

*

Sir Jeremy Cathcart did not receive the news in Whitehall. He was in a private dining room at the Oxford and Cambridge Club, the air thick with the scent of old leather, older port, and quiet power. The mahogany table reflected the soft glow of silver candlesticks. His dining companion was a man in his late sixties, with the benign, forgettable features of a favourite uncle and eyes the colour of a winter sea.

“A regrettable business with the planning officer,” the man said, sipping his claret. He was the Chairman of the Lycurgus Trust’s advisory board. A former Permanent Secretary himself, now gliding between non-executive directorships and the deepest pools of influence. His name was not important. He was a function.

“Regrettable,” Cathcart agreed, meticulously dissecting a medallion of venison. “But contained. The narrative is stabilising. A troubled soul, overwhelmed by the pressures of modern life.”

“And our friend in Edinburgh?”

Cathcart allowed himself a thin, precise smile. “First Minister MacAulay is now tethered to a tragedy of his own making. His credibility, already strained, is now mortally wounded. Every question he asks will be framed as the ravings of a man who drives civil servants to their deaths. It is a far more effective containment than any denial could be.”

“You consider him contained?” The Chairman’s tone was mild, inquisitive.

“I consider him neutered. His moral authority was his core. We have… inoculated the body politic against it.”

“I have a report,” the Chairman said, placing his napkin beside his plate. “From a contact in the Scottish Government’s finance directorate. A curious reallocation of funds. A reactivation of a dormant investment vehicle. Discussions with a certain Glasgow financier known for his… flexible interpretations of fiduciary duty.”

Cathcart’s knife paused halfway to his mouth. The veneer of polished neutrality did not crack, but it cooled by several degrees. “Go on.”

“It appears the First Minister is not retreating into recrimination. He is attempting to… emulate. To create a competing structure. A ‘Civic Infrastructure Fund’.”

For a long moment, the only sound was the faint clink of cutlery from another room. Cathcart carefully finished his mouthful, dabbed his lips, and set the napkin down.

“How crude,” he said, his voice devoid of its usual studied neutrality. It was flat, cold, analytical. “How unexpectedly direct. He is trying to learn the language.”

“A dangerous student. Motivated by grief, or guilt, or a rather pathetic sense of betrayal.”

“No,” Cathcart said, his mind working with a terrible, swift clarity. He had misjudged. He had thought MacAulay a man of principle, which meant a man who could be cornered by his own integrity. But this was not principle. This was pragmatism of the most visceral kind. This was *mimicry*. It was the one thing the mechanism was not designed to handle—a competing, parasitic organism using its own methods. “Not grief. Ambition. A new kind. This is not containment. This is contamination.”

The Chairman raised an eyebrow. “You sound almost impressed.”

“I am assessing. The adjustment regarding Mr. Ellis was necessary. But it has triggered a mutation in the subject. He is no longer trying to expose the machine from without. He is trying to replicate it from within. That makes him not a nuisance, but a rival. A small, dirty, unpredictable rival.”

“And the treatment for a rival?”

Cathcart’s eyes met the Chairman’s across the candlelight. The polished neutrality was gone, stripped away to reveal the cold steel of the function beneath. “One does not contain a rival. One does not discredit them. One excises them. Thoroughly. The political no-confidence is now insufficient. We must move to the commercial. The personal. We must find his new foundation and dissolve it before it sets. We must show him that the language he is trying to speak has syllables he cannot pronounce. We must remind him that the dark is our home. He is merely a visitor.”

He signalled for the bill. The pursuit was no longer bureaucratic. It was existential. And it would be relentless.

*

The storm broke three days later. It did not come from the opposition benches, or the screaming headlines about Ellis. It came in a thick, legal envelope, delivered by hand to the Scottish National Investment Bank.

It was a formal notice of inquiry from the UK Financial Conduct Authority. A *Section 166* notice. A demand for all records, communications, and proposals relating to the proposed “Civic Infrastructure Fund”. The trigger was an anonymous, detailed complaint alleging misuse of public funds, conflicts of interest, and potential market manipulation. The complaint cited specific meetings, named the Glasgow financier, and quoted—with chilling accuracy—phrases from the draft prospectus that had only ever existed in the secure room.

They had not just been watched. They had been *heard*.

Isla stood before MacAulay’s desk, the FCA notice trembling in her hand. “It’s impossible. The room is swept. We used burners for the external calls. Mhairi vouched for the lawyer.”

“They didn’t need a bug,” MacAulay said, staring at the document. His voice was terribly calm. “They have the architecture. They saw the pressure points we were touching—the fund, the financier, the legal framework—and they extrapolated. The complaint is a prophecy written after the event. They are showing us they own the ecosystem. That we breathe their air.”

“The Bank will have to comply. The fund is dead. Stillborn.” Isla’s fury had burnt down to a numb despair. “They didn’t attack you. They attacked the thing you made. They killed the baby in the crib.”

MacAulay took the notice from her. The paper was crisp, official, final. This was the true weight of the reward. It was not the file. It was not the plan. It was the responsibility of having stirred the hive. He had sought a tool, and in doing so, he had made himself a target not for defamation, but for annihilation. Peter Ellis was a warning. This was the first salvo. They would come for the fund, then for the people who conceived it, then for him. They would bury him not in scandal, but in the dense, impenetrable thicket of financial regulation and commercial confidentiality.

He had wanted to be the grit. They were showing him they had industrial magnets that could pluck grit from any gear.

“Leave it with me,” he said.

When she was gone, he walked again to the window. The evening was clear, the sky a hard, cold Prussian blue over the castle. He thought not of stones, but of deep water. Of his makeshift line in the polluted sea. He had felt a tug, and he had pulled, and now he had hooked not a fish, but a leviathan that was turning, with infinite, slow malice, to swallow his boat whole.

The new, cold voice in his head spoke again, for the first time in days. *You have your direction,* it said. *Down. But down is where they live. You are not the fisherman. You are the bait.*

His phone buzzed. A number he didn’t recognise. He answered.

“First Minister.” The voice was cultured, familiar, utterly without warmth. Sir Jeremy Cathcart. “I thought we should speak. Man to man. About sustainability. The Caledonian Resilience Framework is, of course, a UK-wide priority. But I’m given to understand there may be some… local initiatives that could run counter to its strategic aims. Initiatives that might attract unhelpful scrutiny. I believe in clarity, First Minister. In defined roles. I would like to offer some.”

MacAulay said nothing. He listened to the rain of words, soft and apologising, greasing the rails to his surrender.

“The FCA inquiry is a regrettable distraction,” Cathcart continued. “But such things can often be… streamlined. With the right cooperation. Your focus should be on governing Scotland, not on speculative financial vehicles. Let us handle the broader resilience. You have enough on your plate. The death of that poor man, for instance. A terrible burden. You must be desperate to move on.”

The offer was clear. Drop your fund, accept your neutering, mourn your scapegoat, and you may continue to play First Minister in your little theatre. The alternative was not political defeat. It was professional evisceration and personal ruin.

MacAulay watched the first star appear, a pinprick of cold light in the vast darkening blue. He saw the weight of the stone in his hand. The cold, certain heft of it. Throw it, or don’t.

“Sir Jeremy,” he said, his voice quiet, final. “You wanted a fiction. But I am the grit.”

He ended the call. He did not throw the phone. He placed it carefully on the windowsill. The hook was in him deeper than ever. The leviathan was surfacing. He had no boat. No weapon. Only the dirty, useless stone of a truth that was no use to anyone.

But he had his direction.

Down.

And in the dark water below, something vast and hungry had begun to rise.

# Chapter 7

## **CHAPTER 7**

The rain on the window of the safe house was not London rain. It was a hard, wind-driven Glasgow downpour, a percussive rattle against the single pane, washing the sodium glow of the street into bleeding halos. It smelled of wet stone and diesel. Alistair MacAulay stood at the window, not watching the street, but watching the reflection of the room behind him. Morag was hunched over a laptop, her face lit by its sterile blue, fingers flying. Calum was checking the chambers of a compact, ugly pistol, his movements economical, ritualistic. The weight in MacAulay’s hand was no longer a stone. It was a USB drive, small and black and colder than it had any right to be. The Caledonian Resilience Framework. The real one. Not the fiction of parliamentary committees, but the architecture of a quiet annexation. The grit.

“They’ll have triangulated the call,” Calum said, without looking up. His voice was the gravel of a lowland riverbed. “Cathcart’s lot. They won’t come with police. They’ll send contractors. Men who invoice for deniability.”

“How long?” MacAulay asked.

“An hour. Less, if they were already moving.” Calum slid the magazine home with a click that was both definitive and terribly small. “This place is compost.”

Morag snapped the laptop shut. “The data’s clean. Verifiable. Bank trails, shell companies, directives signed in Cathcart’s hand diverting resilience funds to private equity vultures. It’s a scalpel. If we can get it to the right editors, the right committee chairs…”

“If,” MacAulay echoed. The word hung in the damp air of the room, a spectre. He was thinking of the leviathan, not as a beast of the deep, but as a system. A vast, cold-blooded organism that regulated pressure, that could crush a submarine hull with the same indifference as it swallowed a minnow. His truth was the minnow. He turned from the window. “Then we run.”

“Not ‘we,’” Calum said, standing. He was a block of shadow in the poor light. “You two. I’ll be the snag in the net.”

Morag began to protest, a sharp intake of breath, but MacAulay cut her off with a look. He understood. Calum was the stone you threw at the pursuing dog. A simple outcome. A brutal calculus. He saw the acceptance in the older man’s eyes, the weary finality of a man who had long since chosen which dyke he would be part of.

“Where?” MacAulay asked.

“The docks,” Morag said, her voice tight. “There’s a man. A skipper. He doesn’t like questions. He’ll take us up the coast, off the grid. We can surface in a day, somewhere they won’t look.”

The plan was tissue paper in a hurricane. MacAulay knew it. They all did. But it was a direction. He pocketed the drive, its cold seeping through his trousers to his thigh. The first stone in a new wall.

***

The car was a ten-year-old Vauxhall, smell of stale tobacco and damp carpet. Calum drove, his eyes constantly scanning mirrors, side streets, the patterns of headlights behind. The rain had eased to that apologising drizzle again, greasing the cobbles of the Merchant City, making the renovated warehouses loom like black teeth.

MacAulay sat in the back, feeling absurd. A First Minister in the back of a stolen car, fleeing his own capital. The theatre was indeed little. And the audience had turned vicious.

“They’re here,” Calum said, his voice devoid of inflection.

MacAulay saw them then. Two dark SUVs, German, expensive, sliding into the flow of traffic three cars back. They did not hurry. They did not weave. They were a statement of inevitability.

“Can we lose them?” Morag asked from the passenger seat, her knuckles white on the dash.

“In this? No.” Calum took a sudden, hard left down a narrow service lane. The Vauxhall’s suspension groaned. “But I can make them work for it.”

The chase was not the cinematic fury of squealing tyres and shattered glass. It was a grim, damp ballet of rat runs and failed shortcuts. Calum knew the city’s entrails, the arteries behind the Georgian facades. He led the SUVs down alleys strewn with commercial bins, across empty car parks, under railway arches weeping rust. The engines of the pursuing vehicles were a low, persistent growl, a predator’s purr. They matched every turn, closed every gap with calm, terrifying precision. They were not chasing. They were herding.

MacAulay watched the city blur past, a place he was supposed to govern reduced to a maze of escape routes. The weight of the drive was a lodestone. *You are the bait*, Euan’s ghost whispered. The hook was in him, and the line was running out.

They burst onto the wider, empty expanse of Broomielaw, the river a black void to their left. The Clydeside. The SUVs saw their chance and surged forward, one pulling alongside, the other tucking in behind. The window of the lead SUV slid down. MacAulay saw not a face, but the sleek, matte-black shape of a weapon.

“Down!” Calum roared.

The world exploded into noise and spinning glass. Not a gunshot, but a concussive *thump* that punched the side of the Vauxhall. A tyre burst. The car slewed, a dying animal, Calum fighting the wheel as it shrieked across wet tarmac towards the river wall.

Time did not slow. It fractured. MacAulay was thrown against the door. He saw Morag’s head snap forward. He saw the river, hungry and ink-black, rushing up to meet them. The impact was a colossal, jarring stop. The bonnet crumpled against the stone parapet with a sound of shearing metal. The windscreen webbed into a thousand frozen cataracts.

Silence, for a heartbeat. Then the hiss of steam, the drip of fluids. The groan of the dying engine.

Calum was already moving, blood from a cut on his forehead painting a savage stripe down his cheek. “Out! Out now!”

MacAulay shoved his door, stumbled onto the cobbles. The cold air was a shock. The two SUVs had stopped neatly, twenty yards back. Their doors opened. Men emerged. Not thugs. Professionals. Dark clothing, no insignia. They moved with a coordinated, unhurried lethality. Four of them. The one who had fired the grenade—a compact launcher, MacAulay’s mind registered distantly—was reloading.

Morag staggered out, clutching her arm. Her eyes were wide, not with fear, but with a furious, calculating clarity. “The water,” she gasped. “It’s the only way.”

The river. The dark water. The leviathan’s domain. MacAulay looked at the cold, swirling chop ten feet below. It looked like oblivion.

Calum pushed the USB drive into MacAulay’s hand, closing his fingers around it with a grip like iron. “Go. I’ll hold them.”

“Calum, you can’t—”

“I’m not asking.” He looked at MacAulay, and for a fleeting second, the mask of the bodyguard fell away. There was only a tired, proud, furious Scot looking at his First Minister. “You carry the grit. Now *go*.”

He turned, raising his pistol, and began to fire. The shots were sharp, defiant cracks in the damp night. The advancing men scattered, taking cover behind their vehicles. One of them fell, clutching his leg. Calum was a silhouette against the steaming wreck of the car, methodically emptying his magazine, buying seconds with his life.

It was the sacrifice. Not grand, not noble. Desperate and ugly and final. The stone thrown.

“Now, Alistair!” Morag screamed. She was already climbing onto the shattered parapet.

MacAulay climbed. The stone was slick. He heaved himself up, the drive digging into his palm. He looked back once. Calum was hit. He saw the man jolt, but he did not fall. He braced against the car, firing his last round. A second impact spun him around. He slid down the bonnet, leaving a dark trail on the chrome.

The hook tore free. The line snapped.

MacAulay jumped.

***

The cold was an absolute, a physical blow that stole the breath from his lungs and the thought from his mind. It was not water. It was liquid ice, needling through his clothes, clamping around his bones. He plunged deep into the black, disoriented, the world reduced to roaring silence and paralyzing cold.

He fought towards what he hoped was up, his limbs heavy, his heart a frantic drum against the crushing chill. He broke the surface with a gasp that was half a sob. The air felt no warmer. Morag was a few feet away, spluttering, striking out for a shadowy mass downstream—the pilings of an old, disused pier.

He swam, each stroke a monumental effort. The current had them, pulling them along the waterfront. The shouts from the road above were distant, muffled by the blood pounding in his ears. A torch beam swept the water, missed them. He reached the slimy, barnacled concrete of the pier and clung to it, his fingers numb. Morag hauled herself onto a lower ledge, then reached down, grabbing his coat, pulling him up. They collapsed together in a dank, dripping heap under the pier, shrouded in utter blackness.

They lay there, shuddering, listening. Car doors slammed. An engine revved, then faded. They were not coming down. Not yet. The river, for the moment, was considered enough.

“Calum,” MacAulay finally managed, the word chattering out between his teeth.

Morag just shook her head, a sharp movement in the dark. She was hugging herself, her whole body vibrating with cold and shock. After a minute, she fumbled in a zipped pocket. A small, waterproof torch flickered on, its beam a frail, brave thing in the immense dark. She shone it on his face, then her own.

“The drive?” she asked, her voice raw.

He held it up. The little black slab. It glistened. He had not let go. Not even in the water.

“We need to move,” she said. “They’ll send a boat. Or drones. They won’t stop.”

“The skipper?”

“A mile. That way.” She nodded east, into the deeper industrial gloom.

They moved like ghosts, like rats. Under the pier, through a landscape of dereliction—rotting wharves, skeletal cranes against the cloud-choked sky, the hulks of dead industry. The smell was of rust, stagnant water, and decay. The perfect mirror of the polished, liquid corruption they carried in their hands. Their clothes clung, leaden and freezing. Every shadow was a threat, every distant sound a hunter.

They reached a smaller, timber jetty, thrust like a rotten tooth into the river. A boat was tied there—not a sleek launch, but a grimy, functional forty-foot fishing vessel, its paint peeling, its name, *Morna*, barely legible. A light glowed in the wheelhouse.

A man appeared on deck, silhouetted. He was thick-set, bearded, holding a heavy torch. He said nothing.

“Angus,” Morag called, her voice a hoarse whisper. “It’s Morag. Euan’s sister.”

The man lowered the torch. “Heard the commotion. You’re late. And you’re wet.” His accent was island-broad. “Get aboard. Quickly.”

They scrambled onto the deck, which felt like solid land after the water. Angus looked them up and down, his eyes lingering on MacAulay’s face. Recognition flickered, but was swiftly buried under a layer of pragmatic indifference. “Below. Kettle’s on. There’s blankets. Don’t drip on the charts.”

As MacAulay moved towards the hatch, a new sound cut through the river’s murmur. Not a car. A low, resonant thrumming from the sky. Growing closer.

Angus froze, looking up. “That’s not polis.”

A searchlight speared down from the darkness, a blade of white brilliance that swept across the jetty, the boat, pinning them in its glare. It was mounted on a sleek, black helicopter, its shape angular, unmarked. It hovered, a mechanical dragonfly, the downwash from its blades churning the water into a frenzy.

The side door of the helicopter slid open. A figure stood there, harnessed, backlit by the interior light. Even at this distance, the posture was unmistakable. The polished neutrality. Sir Jeremy Cathcart did not shout. A loudhailer amplified his voice, making it a god’s voice, calm and reasonable, dripping onto the scene below.

“First Minister. This is needlessly dramatic. And terribly cold. Come ashore. Let’s discuss sustainability. Like civilised men.”

MacAulay stood on the deck, soaked and shaking, the grit in his hand. The leviathan was not in the water. It was in the air, in the system, in the cultured voice offering him a warm car and a quiet end. The forces had closed in. The sacrifice had been made. The escape was a phantom. He was out of river.

He looked at the USB drive. The cold, certain heft of it. Throw it, or don’t.

He thought of Calum, braced against the car. He thought of Euan, broken on the rocks. He thought of a drystane dyke, each stone chosen, each placement an act of faith against the wind.

He was not the fisherman. He was not the bait. He was the grit. And grit had only one purpose.

He turned to Morag, his voice quiet, final, lost under the rotor’s thunder. “Get it to the light. However you can.”

He saw the understanding in her eyes, and the protest, and the grim acceptance. She gave a single, sharp nod.

Then MacAulay turned away from the boat, away from the last chance of flight. He stepped back onto the rotten jetty. He walked, not towards the shore where the SUVs would now be waiting, but into the centre of the blinding searchlight, a small, dark figure in a circle of manufactured day.

He looked up at the hovering machine, at the silhouette in the door. He raised the hand that did not hold the drive. Not a wave. A summons.

The loudhailer crackled. “A wise choice, First Minister.”

“No, Sir Jeremy,” MacAulay said, too softly for anyone to hear. “It’s an invitation.”

Behind him, he heard the grumble of the *Morna*’s diesel engine firing to life. He did not look back. He kept walking, keeping the light on him, a bright, perfect target. The helicopter descended slightly, turning to keep him illuminated. The jetty groaned under his feet.

He reached the end. There was nowhere else to go. Just black water, and the light, and the eye of the beast.

He stopped. He held up the USB drive, letting the light glint off its plastic shell. Then he drew back his arm, and with all the strength left in his frozen body, he threw it. Not into the water. But in a high, glinting arc towards the far, dark bank, into a wilderness of rust and shadow.

The gesture was futile. It would be found. They would scour every inch. But it was a stone thrown. A declaration.

The searchlight did not waver from him. The helicopter’s nose dipped. It began its final, slow approach to the jetty, to collect its prize.

But MacAulay was no longer looking at it. He was looking past the glare, into the deeper darkness of the city. And he was not waiting. The choice was made. The direction was set.

To face the pursuing evil was not to surrender to it. It was to become the snag. The stone in the shoe. The grit in the eye of the god in the machine.

The downdraft whipped his hair, flattened his sodden clothes against his body. The skid of the helicopter touched the timber.

Alistair MacAulay, First Minister of Scotland, stood his ground, and prepared to speak.

# Chapter 8

## **CHAPTER 8**

The light was not a light. It was a substance. A solid, viscous thing that pinned him to the rotten timber of the jetty, that filled his mouth and lungs with the taste of burnt dust and aviation fuel. Alistair MacAulay stood within it, a specimen on a slide. The helicopter’s skid kissed the wood with a gentle, final tap, a lover’s greeting. The downdraft died to a resentful sigh.

From the machine’s dark belly, a figure descended. Not Sir Jeremy. Jeremy was a conductor, not a player. This was a man in tactical black, moving with the unthinking economy of a tool being used. He stepped onto the jetty, and the old planks, which had groaned under MacAulay’s own weight, accepted him without sound. He held out a hand. It was empty, but it was not a request.

MacAulay looked past the gloved hand, past the helmeted, anonymous face, into the open door of the helicopter. Another man sat there, in a suit the colour of a winter sky. He was reading something on a tablet, the screen’s glow painting his features a sickly blue. He did not look up.

“First Minister,” said the man in black. His voice was filtered, flat. “You will come with us.”

MacAulay did not move. He let the silence stretch, let it become a thing in itself, a third presence on the jetty. He was thinking of the stone he had thrown. Not the drive—that was a feint, a piece of theatre. The real stone was the one in his mind, the cold certainty he had pulled from the dyke of his own resolve. *Throw it, or don’t.* He had thrown it. The arc was still in the air.

“I am the First Minister of Scotland,” he said, his voice carrying over the idle thrum of the rotor. It was not loud. It was merely factual, a statement of geology. “You are on Scottish soil. You will state your authority.”

The man in the suit in the helicopter looked up. He smiled. It was a thin, administrative smile, the kind that accompanies a minor correction in a ledger. He placed the tablet aside and swung his legs out, landing on the jetty with a soft thud. He was taller than he had seemed, his neatness imposing.

“Authority, Alistair? Really?” He brushed an invisible speck from his sleeve. “The theatre of the state is for the public gallery. This…” He gestured to the dark water, the derelict warehouses, the circle of brutal light. “This is the green room. Where the real props are kept.”

MacAulay knew him. Charles Wenton. Cabinet Office. A civil servant who had forgotten he was a servant, who curated power like a private collection. A man who wore his access like Sir Jeremy wore his knighthood, but without the tailoring. It was sewn into his skin.

“Charles. I should have known the foot soldiers would have a quartermaster.”

Wenton’s smile didn’t flicker. “We have the drive, Alistair. My colleagues are retrieving it now. The *Morna* is impounded. Your… gallant Captain Nevin is being helped to understand the new realities. The performance is over. The only remaining question is the dignity of your exit.”

MacAulay looked past him, into the darkness where he had thrown the drive. He saw pinpricks of light moving, methodical as beetles. They would find it. They would take it. That was the script. But a play could have more than one act.

“An exit requires a stage,” MacAulay said. “This is a wet dock in Leith. Not a fitting finale.”

“Oh, we have a stage,” Wenton said. He nodded to the man in black, who took a careful step forward. “A quiet room. A comfortable chair. A statement to the effect that the pressures of office, combined with the tragic, unresolved loss of your wife, have necessitated a period of recuperation. The sympathetic narrative. It’s already written. It has a certain grace, don’t you think?”

The words were a dentist’s drill on a nerve. *The loss of your wife.* They had always been there, in the background of every threat, the final, unspoken sanction. To use her now, to make her memory a tool for this… it did not kindle a fire in him. It turned him to ice. To something as hard and cold and patient as granite.

“Grace,” MacAulay repeated. The word was a stone in his mouth. “You wouldn’t know grace if it built a drystane dyke around your Whitehall office.”

He turned then, not towards the helicopter, but to face the city. The searchlight still held him, but he ignored its insistence. He looked at the jagged silhouette of Edinburgh, at the arrogant poke of the Scott Monument, the hump of the Castle rock. His city. Not theirs.

“My authority,” he said, his voice lifting just enough to carry over the water, “doesn’t come from a piece of paper in London. It comes from the people standing on that rock. And they are watching this little pantomime.”

Wenton followed his gaze, a flicker of unease finally crossing his polished face. The pinprick lights on the far bank had stopped moving. A new sound entered the night—not the growl of an engine, but a murmur. A crowd murmur. From the road above the docks, along the old seawall, figures were gathering. Dozens. Then hundreds. Silhouettes against the sodium glow of the city, their breath making plumes in the cold air. They were silent, just a dark, massed presence. Watching.

“A phone call from a trawler,” MacAulay said, almost to himself. “A word to a friend. A friend speaks to a neighbour. It’s a slow fuse, Jeremy. But it burns.”

“This is idiocy,” Wenton hissed, his administrative calm cracking. “They can’t do anything. They’re spectators.”

“Aye,” MacAulay said, turning back to him. The light was at his back now, casting his own shadow long and thin over Wenton and the man in black. “But you see, Charles, you need the dark for your work. You need empty places. You’ve brought your light here, and you’ve shown them exactly where you are. And what you are.”

He took a step forward. The man in black tensed, but MacAulay’s movement was not an attack. It was a closing of distance, a politician’s instinct. He spoke now for Wenton’s ears alone.

“You have the drive. Good. It’s encrypted. The key is in twelve parts. Six are with people in that crowd. The other six are with people who, if I am not standing in my own Parliament by noon tomorrow, will release everything they have to every news outlet from here to Hong Kong. The *Morna*’s hold was the decoy. The truth is a virus. It’s already airborne.”

Wenton stared at him. The tablet-generated certainty drained from his face, leaving something pale and furious underneath. “You’re bluffing. You wouldn’t risk that kind of chaos.”

“Chaos?” MacAulay gave a short, bleak laugh. “I spent a year trying to build order. To work within the machine. The machine spat me out. So I learned the older rules. You don’t fight the flood. You become the stone that breaks the current. You are the chaos now, Charles. And that crowd up there? They’re not spectators. They’re the jury. And you just showed them the crime.”

From the road above, a single voice rang out, clear and sharp on the cold air. “*Alistair!*”

Then another. “*First Minister!*”

It was not a chant. Not yet. It was a testing of the silence. A stone dropped into a pond.

Wenton’s head swivelled between MacAulay and the gathering darkness on the wall. His hand went to his ear, to a hidden comms piece. He listened, his face tightening. “The retrieval team… they’re being… approached. Civilians. A lot of them.”

MacAulay said nothing. He simply stood, a man at the end of a jetty, waiting for the tide to turn.

The man in black moved, his hand going to his hip. But Wenton shot out a arm. “No. Not here. Not with…” He waved a desperate hand at the wall of watching faces.

The calculus had changed. The green room had a leak. The audience was flooding in.

“This isn’t over,” Wenton spat, the polished veneer gone, revealing the raw, cheap material beneath.

“It never is,” MacAulay said. “It just changes venue. Tell Sir Jeremy I’ll see him in Holyrood. We have a budget to discuss.”

For a long moment, Wenton hovered on the edge of something reckless. But the murmur from the wall was growing, coalescing into a word, a name. He heard it. They all heard it. The machine was not built for this. It was built for darkness and whispers and the soft, apologising rain of London. Not for the hard, naming light of a Scottish night.

With a jerk of his head, Wenton turned and climbed back into the helicopter. The man in black followed, his movements still precise, but now touched with a haste that looked like fear. The engine pitch rose to a scream. The searchlight winked out, plunging the jetty into a blindness more profound than the glare.

MacAulay did not shield his eyes. He let the dark wash over him, let his night vision return. He saw the helicopter lift, turn, and slide away over the water, a malevolent insect fleeing the dawn.

The sound of the rotors faded, replaced by the sound of the crowd. A steady, rhythmic clapping now. Not a cheer. Something slower. More deliberate. Like the beating of a heart.

He turned and began the long walk back down the jetty. His legs were weak, the adrenaline receding like the tide, leaving him hollow and shaking. But he walked. One foot in front of the other on the rotten wood. Towards the shore.

Towards the people who were not his shield, but his witness.

***

The car that collected him was not a Ministerial Jaguar. It was an old, mud-spattered Volvo estate. The man who drove it was called Donnie, a former constituency party secretary who now ran a garage in Granton. He didn’t speak, just handed MacAulay a tartan travel rug and a thermos of sweet, scalding tea.

They drove not to the Parliament, nor to the official residence. They drove to a small, stone-built kirk hall in the Stockbridge colonies. The room smelled of damp wool, old hymn books, and coffee. About thirty people were there, sitting on folding chairs. They were not the powerful. They were the secretaries, the researchers, the junior ministers whose names never made the papers, the police constables, the boatyard workers. The grit.

Fiona was there. Her face was pale, her eyes red-rimmed from sleeplessness and fury. She said nothing when he entered. She just walked over and put a hand on his arm, a brief, fierce pressure that said everything.

A woman with a laptop—Mairi, from the IT department—nodded to him. “The fragments are safe. The dead man’s switches are armed. They have the shell. We have the kernel.”

He had not been bluffing.

He stood before them, the travel rug still over his shoulders. He had no speech. “I’m sorry,” he said, his voice rough. “I brought this to your doors.”

An older man, a trade unionist from the docks, shook his head. “Ye didnae bring it, son. It was always here. Ye just had the eyes to see it, and the neck to name it.”

They talked then, not as a leader and followers, but as conspirators after a failed coup, assessing the damage. The *Morna* was held. Nevin was in custody, but a lawyer—one of theirs—was already there. The media was a rolling boil of rumour: a First Minister missing, a security incident in Leith, mysterious helicopters. London was emitting calm, bland statements about coordinated exercises and maritime security.

“They’ll try to box you,” said a sharp-faced woman from the Justice department. “Medical leave. A committee. An inquiry that lasts forever.”

“They’ll try,” MacAulay agreed. He felt the weight of the stone in his hand again. But it was no longer for throwing. It was a foundation. “But they showed their hand tonight. They used force on Scottish soil. Against its elected head. They threatened, they intimidated, they illuminated their own dirty work for half of Leith to see. That’s not a story they can bury. It’s one we have to tell.”

“How?” asked Donnie from the driver’s seat, his voice a low growl.

MacAulay looked at the faces in the dim hall. The resolute, the afraid, the angry. The grit in the eye of the god in the machine.

“We speak,” he said. “Not from a podium. From the ground. Fiona, you’ll handle the official channel. Demand a statement from the Prime Minister. Demand the return of the *Morna* and her crew. Use the words ‘act of aggression’. Use the word ‘sovereignty’.”

Fiona was already taking notes, her professional mask back in place, but her pen was driving into the paper.

“The rest of you,” he continued, “you talk. To journalists you trust. To your neighbours. In the pub. On the ferry. Don’t spin. Just tell them what you saw, or what you know. A helicopter. Men with guns. On our docks. Taking our First Minister. Let them sit with that picture.”

He saw the doubt on some faces. The fear of being marked, of careers ending in quiet, administrative purgatory.

“I can’t protect you,” he said bluntly. “If you do this, they will come for you. Slowly, politely, but they will come. So you only do it if you believe the picture is more important than your pension. If you believe this place…,” he gestured out the window, into the dark, close streets of the colonies, “…is more than a region to be managed.”

The silence that followed was thick. Then Mairi, from IT, closed her laptop with a definitive click. “My grandfather helped build the *Morna*. I’m in.”

One by one, they nodded. Not with cheers, but with a slow, grave acceptance. It was a covenant.

As they began to leave, in ones and twos, Fiona stayed. When the hall was empty, she said, “They’ll kill the story in London. The BBC, the broadsheets. They’ll call it a ‘security misunderstanding’.”

“Then we don’t tell it in London,” MacAulay said. He was looking at a map of Scotland on the wall, a faded thing left over from a Sunday school. “We tell it here. In words this land understands. Not as a political scandal. As a ballad.”

He turned to her. “Call Eilidh at the *National*. Call Hamish at the *Herald*. But also call Calum, the folk singer. Call the lass who does the history walks. Call the poet from Lewis. Give them the facts. Let them find the music in it. A king taken in the night. A boat seized. A light in the darkness. It’s an old story. We just need to sing it again.”

He saw the understanding dawn in her eyes. Not admiration, but a kind of grim recognition. He was not just fighting power. He was fighting story with story. And he was using the oldest one he knew.

“Where will you go?” she asked. “You can’t go home. Or to Parliament. They’ll be waiting.”

“I know,” he said. He thought of the stone dykes on the hills above Lammermuir. Of a weight in his hand. A direction set. “I’m going to ground. But not to hide. To be the snag.”

***

The cottage was not his. It belonged to a cousin of Donnie’s, a forester who asked no questions. It was two rooms of whitewashed stone, buried in a fold of the Pentland hills south of the city. There was no electricity. A spring for water. A fireplace for heat and light.

MacAulay built a fire as the deep, star-scattered dark of true countryside settled around him. The silence was immense. It was not the absence of sound, but the presence of an older, slower rhythm: the wind in the heather, the trickle of the burn, the settling of stone.

He was waiting.

He knew they would come. Wenton’s failure would require correction. Sir Jeremy would not send a helicopter this time. He would send a whisper. A suggestion to a loyal Chief Constable. A concern about the mental welfare of a distressed politician, alone in a remote location. A welfare visit. And in the confusion, a misstep. A tragic accident. A body at the bottom of a rocky burn. It would be neat. Sympathetic. It had the grace of the earlier narrative, but with a more permanent finale.

MacAulay sat by the fire, a blanket around him. He was not armed. He had no phone. He had only the firelight and the waiting.

He thought of his wife. Not as a weapon used against him, but as she was. Her laugh, which had been like light on water. Her impatience with politics. “You’re building dykes in a flood, Ali,” she’d said once, not unkindly. He’d thought she meant it was futile. Now he wondered if she meant he was using the wrong stones.

The fire cracked and spat. A peat fire, smelling of ancient earth.

He heard the car long before he saw its lights. It was a slow, careful approach up the rough track. One set of lights. Not a convoy. A single, official vehicle. It stopped a hundred yards down the hill. Doors opened and closed with solid, deliberate thumps. Two figures. Then a third.

He stayed in his chair. He did not look towards the door.

They would knock first. There would be a show of procedure.

The knock came. Firm. Authoritative.

“Come in,” MacAulay called, his voice calm. “The door’s open.”

The door opened. A man in a heavy police coat stood there, his face ruddy in the firelight. Behind him, another uniform. And behind them, a man in a dark overcoat. Not Wenton. Someone higher. Someone from the security services, his face a blank page.

“First Minister,” the policeman said. His voice was strained, caught between protocol and orders. “We’ve been… concerned for your welfare. This is a very isolated place. Given the strain you’ve been under…”

“I’m quite well, Chief Inspector,” MacAulay said, still not rising. “Thank you for your concern. You can go now.”

The man in the overcoat stepped forward, past the policemen. He had kind eyes. That was the most dangerous thing about him. “Alistair. May I call you Alistair? This isn’t about blame. Or politics. It’s about health. You’ve been through a terrible ordeal. We’re here to help. To take you somewhere safe. Where you can rest. Where you won’t be a danger to yourself.”

The words were velvet. The meaning beneath was iron.

“A danger to myself,” MacAulay repeated. He poked the fire with a stick. A shower of sparks rose up the chimney. “Is that the new story? Not a resignation. A breakdown. More graceful. More… final.”

The kind-eyed man’s expression didn’t change. “There’s no story. Only care. Please. Come with us.”

MacAulay looked at him then. Really looked. He saw the infinite, weary certainty of the machine. It did not hate him. It simply needed to correct his error, to smooth the snag. It would do it with kindness, if possible. With force, if necessary. But it would be done.

This was the final test. Not on a jetty in a circle of light, but here, in the quiet dark. Facing not a threat, but an offer of erasure wrapped in compassion.

He thought of the crowd on the seawall. Of Mairi’s decisive click. Of the old dockworker’s words. *Ye just had the eyes to see it.*

He laid the poker down.

“No,” he said.

The word was quiet. Absolute.

The kind-eyed man sighed, a sound of genuine regret. He gave a slight nod to the Chief Inspector.

The policeman stepped forward, his hand coming out, not to strike, but to take hold. “Sir, I must insist…”

MacAulay did not resist. He looked past the policeman, to the open door. To the dark beyond.

“You should probably shut that,” he said. “There’s a draft.”

And into the draft, from the darkness outside, came other figures. Silhouettes, blocking the starlight. They moved into the doorway, into the firelight.

Donnie, from the garage, holding a heavy wrench loosely at his side. The trade unionist from the docks. Two young farmers from the next glen, their faces set. And Mairi, from IT, holding a mobile phone aloft, its screen glowing.

“Chief Inspector,” Mairi said, her voice clear and cutting. “This call is live to three radio stations. They are broadcasting the sound from this room. Would you like to repeat your insistence to the audience?”

The policeman froze, his hand inches from MacAulay’s arm. He looked at the phone, at the faces in the doorway. The script had been torn up. This was not a quiet extraction. This was a scene.

The kind-eyed man’s face lost its kindness. It became cold, analytical. He was calculating the cost. The soundbite. The witnesses. The live feed. The snag had multiplied.

“This is a mistake,” he said softly, to MacAulay alone.

“It’s a choice,” MacAulay replied. He stood now, pushing himself up from the chair. He was tired to his bones, but he stood straight. “You offered me a quiet room. I’m offering you a public square. Which one do you think this land will remember?”

For a long moment, the only sound was the crackle of the fire and the faint, tinny echo of that crackle from Mairi’s phone speaker, flying out across the airwaves.

The kind-eyed man held his gaze. Then, with a minuscule shake of his head, he turned. He walked out, past the people in the doorway, and vanished into the night.

The Chief Inspector looked desperately from MacAulay to the phone, to the grim faces of the men in the doorway. He lowered his hand. “This is… highly irregular.”

“Aye,” said Donnie, hefting the wrench. “It is.”

The policemen left, their retreat less orderly than their approach. The car started, its lights sweeping wildly as it turned, and then it was gone, bouncing back down the track.

The group in the doorway relaxed, a collective release of breath. Mairi lowered the phone. “They heard it,” she said. “All of it.”

MacAulay nodded. He felt no triumph. Only a vast, hollow exhaustion. The fire was dying down.

“They’ll be back,” the unionist said. “With a different warrant. A different story.”

“I know,” MacAulay said. He looked at the faces of these people who had stood in the dark for him. The grit. “But tonight, the story is ours. Go home. Thank you.”

They left, with quiet words and claps on his shoulder. Donnie was the last. “I’ll be down the track. In the car. In case.”

Then he was alone again. With the dying fire and the immensity of the silent hills.

He walked outside. The cold air was a slap. The stars were a fierce, icy spray across the black velvet of the sky. He looked north, towards the city. He could not see it, but he could feel its presence. A low, troubled glow on the horizon.

He had faced the light. He had faced the kind, erasing dark. He had thrown his stone, and it had landed not with a splash, but with a ripple that was still spreading.

He was not a hero. He was a man who had finally understood the weight in his hand. A stone was not just for throwing. It was for building. And the dyke he had to build now was not around a plot of land, or a political idea. It was around a truth. A small, hard, inconvenient truth that they had tried to take from him in the night.

He went back inside. He built up the fire until it roared, defying the darkness, a beacon in the fold of the hills.

He sat before it, and he waited for the dawn. Not for rescue. For the next move.

The machine was wounded. It was not defeated. A wounded machine was at its most dangerous. It would not send kindness again. It would send something simpler. Something cleaner.

And Alistair MacAulay, the snag, the stone, the grit in the eye, would be waiting. Not with an army. Not with a strategy.

With a story. And a fire. And the certain, cold weight of the truth in his hand.

Outside, in the vast and listening dark, the first bird began to sing.

# Chapter 9

## **CHAPTER 9**

The dawn that came to the glen was a slow, reluctant thing. It did not break; it seeped, a grey infusion leaching into the black broth of the night, revealing the hills not as shapes but as deeper densities of shadow. MacAulay watched it from his chair by the fire, which had burned down to a cradle of pulsating peat. The bird that had sung in the dark had been joined by others, a scattered, questioning chorus in the mist. It was not a cheerful sound. It was a reckoning.

He moved through the cold cottage like a man in a museum of his own life. The kettle on the range, the worn spine of a book on the mantel, the view from the sink to the old rowan tree. They were the same, and they were utterly changed. He was seeing them through the lens of their absence, as if last night’s warrant had already been executed, the contents catalogued and removed. This was the ordinary world, returned to him. But it felt provisional now, a loan from the machine. He touched the dry, cool stone of the hearth. A stone for building. The thought was solid, but the ground beneath it felt soft.

The phone rang at half-seven. A sound like a shard of ice. He let it ring three times before answering.

“Alistair.” It was Moira, his constituency secretary. Her voice, usually a steady, no-nonsense instrument, was frayed at the edges. “Are you… are you in one piece?”

“More or less.” He looked at his hand, curled around the receiver. It was clean. There was no soot from the fire, no grit from the struggle. It was just a hand. “The news is out, then.”

A short, sharp laugh on the line. “Oh, it’s out. It’s doing the polka on every bulletin. ‘Dawn Raid on First Minister’s Home’. ‘Whitehall’s Midnight Knock’. The London desks are calling it a ‘security consultation’. Ours are calling it what it is.” She paused. He could hear the clatter of a keyboard, the hum of an office already at full tilt. “They’ve recalled Parliament. Emergency session. This afternoon.”

Of course they had. The machine, wounded, was moving to sterilise the narrative. A parliamentary statement, a minister expressing regret for the ‘misunderstanding’, a promise of a review. The kind, erasing dark of procedure.

“What’s the mood?” he asked.

“Here?” She lowered her voice. “It’s quiet. A bad quiet. The kind that comes before a shout. The party office… it’s like a wake and a wedding at the same time. People are furious. And they’re proud. It’s a volatile mix.”

He nodded, though she couldn’t see. “Tell them to be calm. Tell them to listen today. To watch the words they use. We’re not the victims. We’re the witnesses.”

“And what are we witnessing, Alistair?” The question was not a challenge, but a plea for the script.

“A state,” he said quietly, “forgetting that it is supposed to be a servant. And remembering that it has other, older tools.” He heard her breath catch. “I’ll be down by noon, Moira. Have the briefing ready. Not the one they prepared. The one we write this morning.”

He placed the receiver back in its cradle. The silence of the cottage rushed back in, but it was different now. It had been breached. It was no longer a fortress of solitude, but a command post, austere and temporary. He was not a man coming home. He was a man preparing to depart from it.

***

The car that came for him was not his official Jaguar. It was Donnie’s own vehicle, a mud-spattered Land Rover that smelled of dog and diesel and earth. Donnie said nothing as MacAulay climbed in, just handed him a flask. The coffee inside was hot and bitter.

They drove down the single-track road, the tyres hissing on the damp tarmac. The glen unfurled in the morning light, a spectacle of green and grey grandeur that MacAulay saw now as a series of strategic points: the bend where a car could be forced off the road, the high crag that could serve as a lookout, the bridge that was the only way in or out. He was mapping vulnerability. The gift of last night.

“They were back at first light,” Donnie said, his eyes on the road. His big, farmer’s hands were gentle on the wheel. “Two of them. In a different car. A grey Volvo. Parked up at the junction to the main road. Taking pictures.”

“Did they approach?”

“No. Just watched. I walked down. Stood and stared at them until they left.” Donnie allowed himself a thin smile. “It’s an old skill. Staring. You don’t get good at it in Whitehall.”

“They were establishing a new baseline,” MacAulay said, more to himself than to Donnie. “Seeing what normal looks like, so they know when it changes. So they can provoke the change.”

“Aye, well,” Donnie said, shifting gears as they climbed a rise. “Their normal now includes a daft auld bugger in a wax jacket giving them the evil eye from a drystane dyke. Let them make of that what they will.”

They crested the rise, and the city lay before them in the hazy distance, a geometric smudge on the firth. The low, troubled glow of night had hardened into the cold gleam of a weekday morning. It did not look like a seat of power. It looked like a machine laid bare, its cogs and pistons exposed, waiting for the first shovelful of coal to be thrown into its furnace.

“They’ll come for you differently now,” Donnie said, the lightness gone. “Not with paper. With people. With whispers.”

“I know.”

“You’re ready for that? For the friends who stop calling? The colleagues who look the other way in the corridor? The story in the paper about your father, or your finances, or a mistake you made twenty years ago?”

MacAulay watched the city grow larger. “My father was a schoolteacher who drank too much. My finances are a mess of mortgage and ministerial salary. My mistakes are legion. They’re welcome to them. They’re just more stones.” He took a sip of the brutal coffee. “The truth isn’t the facts about you, Donnie. It’s the fact of you. They can’t take that. They can only try to make you forget its weight.”

Donnie grunted, a sound of dubious approval. “Philosophy. That’ll be a great comfort when they’re pouring the poison in the ears of everyone you know.”

“It’s not philosophy,” MacAulay said. “It’s geology.”

They drove the rest of the way in a silence that was not empty, but filled with the unspoken shorthand of a long friendship. It was the sharing of the elixir, not in words, but in presence. The reward was not safety, but solidarity. The wisdom was not that the machine could be beaten, but that it could be endured, and in enduring, revealed.

***

The Scottish Parliament building, when they approached it, was surrounded. Not by police, but by people. A crowd, several hundred strong, spilling out of the landscaped gardens and onto the road. They were not chanting. They were not waving large flags. They stood in small, quiet knots, or alone, holding simple, hand-lettered signs. ‘PROTECT OUR DEMOCRACY’. ‘NO TO MIDNIGHT KNOPS’. ‘WE ARE WATCHING’.

His heart, a cold, clenched thing in his chest, gave a single, hard thump.

Donnie slowed the Land Rover to a crawl. “I can’t get you to the minister’s entrance. Not through this.”

“Stop here,” MacAulay said.

“Alistair, you can’t just–”

“Stop the car, Donnie.”

He did. MacAulay opened the door and stepped out into the cool, damp air. The sound of the engine died. For a moment, there was just the murmur of the crowd, the sigh of the wind off the firth. Then a woman near the front saw him. She nudged the man beside her. A ripple of recognition went through them, not a roar, but a softening, a focusing.

He did not wave. He did not smile the politician’s smile. He simply began to walk, his shoes loud on the pavement, through the avenue that opened for him. He felt their eyes on him. Not the adoring gaze of the rally, nor the hostile glare of the protest. It was a measuring look. A judging. They were seeing the man from the news, the man in the doorway with the fire behind him, and they were comparing him to this tired figure in a rumpled coat, walking alone.

An older man, his face a roadmap of wrinkles under a flat cap, stepped forward as MacAulay passed. He didn’t offer his hand. He simply said, in a voice like gravel, “They canny do that, son.”

MacAulay met his eyes. They were pale blue, fierce. “They thought they could.”

The man held his gaze for a long second, then gave a single, slow nod. “Aye. Well. See that they learn different.”

It was a mandate. Harder and more real than any election certificate. He walked on, the crowd closing behind him like water. He was not their champion. He was their litmus test. Their proof that a line still existed, and that it would not be crossed without someone getting their boots muddy. He was being recognised, not for a journey, but for becoming a landmark.

Inside the cavernous, modernist foyer, the silence was of a different quality. The glass and concrete seemed to hold its breath. Staff paused, coffee cups in hand, to watch him pass. Some offered tight, nervous smiles. Others looked away quickly. The poison was already in the air, a sweet, scentless gas of doubt. *He provoked them. He’s playing the martyr. What was he really hiding?*

Moira was waiting at the door to his office, a sheaf of papers clutched to her chest like a shield. Her eyes were wide. “You walked through them?”

“They’re not a mob, Moira. They’re a jury.”

“The London correspondents are in the media gallery. They’re calling it a constitutional crisis.”

“It’s not a crisis,” he said, entering the office. It was too warm, the air stale. “A crisis is when the system fails. This is the system working exactly as it was designed to. We’re just unused to seeing the design.”

He shrugged off his coat. On his desk, the briefing folders were laid out with geometric precision. Next to them, alone on the polished wood, lay a single, smooth, grey river stone. He picked it up. Its weight was perfect, familiar.

“Who left this?”

Moira coloured slightly. “I did. This morning. I found it on the beach last weekend. It seemed… appropriate.”

He placed it back on the desk, not as an ornament, but as a paperweight. An anchor for the fluttering, insubstantial pages of the state’s reality. “It is. Thank you.”

The day was a blur of grim theatre. The emergency session was a masterpiece of calibrated outrage. His own side, furious and florid, painting him as a modern-day Covenantor besieged in his own home. The opposition, careful, expressing ‘grave concern’ while probing with delicate, poisoned needles about the ‘specific security considerations’ that had prompted such an ‘unfortunate operational overreach’. The London Minister, a sleek man named Timms, was a study in contrition without concession. *Regrettable. Unprecedented. Lessons will be learned.* The language was a soft blanket, meant to smother the fire.

MacAulay sat through it, a still point in the churning chamber. He did not scribble notes. He did not confer in frantic whispers. He listened, his hand resting on the cool stone in his pocket, the brother of the one on his desk.

When he rose to speak, the chamber fell into a hush so complete he could hear the rustle of the presiding officer’s robes.

“I thank the Minister for his explanation,” he began, his voice not booming, but carrying, a low, clear tone in the sterile space. “And I note his regret. But we are not here to discuss a procedural error. We are not here to review operational guidelines.” He paused, letting his gaze travel across the faces turned towards him—the eager, the hostile, the merely curious. “We are here because men with the authority of the state, in the dead of night, sought to enter the home of the elected First Minister of Scotland and seize the private records of his family. They did not come with accusations. They came with a warrant so broad it was a blank page. They did not come for a crime. They came for a story. And not even a true story. The story they wanted was a simple one: that I, and by extension this Parliament, and by further extension the people we represent, are a problem to be managed. A security concern to be contained.”

He leaned forward, his hands on the lectern. “They brought their light. And they found, I hope, that some things are not illuminated by being shone upon. Some things are only revealed by the dark they hold within themselves. A sense of justice. A love of place. The simple, stubborn weight of a right.”

He did not look at the London Minister. He looked at the stone walls of the chamber itself. “They thought they were conducting a search. They were, in fact, conducting a survey. They were testing the ground. To see if it would hold. To see if we would hold.” He straightened. “I stand here not to demand an apology, but to offer a testimony. The ground held. We held. The machine encountered a snag. And a snag is not an obstruction. It is a discovery. It tells you where the fabric is weak. Where it needs to be rewoven, or cut away entirely.”

He sat down. The silence persisted for a three-count, then broke into a storm—applause from his benches, a low rumble of discontent from the others. The presiding officer called for order. MacAulay did not hear it. He was looking at the public gallery, at the faces of the people who had stood outside. They were not cheering. They were watching, still. Judging. He had given them not a victory speech, but a report. The elixir shared was cold comfort: the knowledge that they lived in a machine that surveyed its own people. And the colder knowledge that they had, for one night, made it hesitate.

***

The new normal established itself in the weeks that followed with the quiet insistence of moss growing over a scar. The public inquiry was announced, its terms of reference narrow, its timeline stretching comfortably into the middle distance. The ‘kindness’ was over. In its place was a cool, professional distance. Meetings in London were punctiliously courteous, impeccably minuted, and utterly fruitless. The flow of information, once a river, became a trickle of pre-vetted, publicly available drips. It was governance by suffocation.

MacAulay’s life became a series of small, symbolic resistances. He refused the upgraded security detail, keeping only Donnie’s unofficial, watchful presence. He worked from the cottage two days a week, a logistical headache for the civil service that was itself a statement. He began to write, not policy papers, but a weekly column for a small nationalist newspaper, using plain language about power, sovereignty, and the quiet corrosion of consent. It was read, his press secretary told him with strained patience, ‘in the highest quarters’. He knew what that meant. They were adding it to his file.

One evening, late, he found himself in the garden. The rowan tree was heavy with crimson berries. The first frosts were coming. He held another stone, this one from the burn at the bottom of his land, water-smoothed and dark. The dyke at the edge of the property had a gap in it, where sheep had pushed through. He walked over to it, knelt in the damp grass, and began to work.

It was hard, physical labour. The stones were heavy, their shapes stubborn. He had to find the right fit, the natural plane that would lock against its neighbour, creating friction, creating hold. His hands grew cold and dirty. His back ached. It was mindless, absorbing, profoundly satisfying.

He did not hear her approach until she was almost upon him. Catriona. She had a bottle of wine in one hand and two glasses in the other. She stood watching him for a minute, her head tilted.

“I rang the office. Moira said you’d be here. Building your wall.”

“Repairing it,” he grunted, settling a heavy, angular stone into place. It sat perfectly.

“Is there a difference?”

He sat back on his heels, wiping his hands on his trousers. “Aye. Building is from nothing. Repairing is an act of faith. A belief that the original design was sound. That it’s worth restoring.”

She poured the wine, handed him a glass. They didn’t clink them. They drank, the wine a sharp, red warmth in the cooling air.

“They’re going to isolate you, Alistair,” she said softly. “They’re going to make you the issue. Not what happened. Not what it means. Just you. Your temperament. Your ‘confrontational style’. They’ll turn your strength into a pathology.”

“I know.”

“And you’re just going to… mend walls?”

He looked at the section he’d repaired. It was only a few feet. The dyke ran for hundreds of yards, over the hill and out of sight. “It’s not just a wall, Cat. It’s a line. It says: this is mine to care for. This is my responsibility. The machine understands lines. It draws them on maps. It writes them in legislation. It just doesn’t like it when we draw our own.” He took another sip. “This is the new normal. Not peace. Not victory. A state of careful, watched repair.”

She followed his gaze to the hills, black against a plum-coloured sky. “It’s a lonely normal.”

“It always was,” he said. “I just hadn’t stepped outside to feel it before.”

They finished the wine in silence. The last of the light bled from the west. When she left, he stayed out, feeling the vast, listening dark gather around him once more. It was not an enemy now. It was the medium in which he worked. The fire inside was no longer a beacon of defiance, but the steady, contained glow of a forge. He was not waiting for the next move. He was making it, one stone, one word, one repaired line at a time.

The hook for the next chapter was not a threat, or a sudden arrival. It was the phone, ringing inside the dark cottage. A sound both mundane and monstrous in the quiet. He let it ring. Once. Twice. On the third ring, he went in, not with dread, but with the cold certainty of a man answering a summons he had been expecting all his life.

He picked up the receiver. The voice on the other end was not Sir Jeremy’s polished neutrality. It was a voice he knew from television, calm, reasonable, and freighted with an entirely new kind of weight.

“First Minister? We need to talk. Not as government and opposition. But as two men who can see the cliff edge. Before the people behind us, on both sides, get us there.”

It was the Leader of the Opposition. And he was calling from a private number, after dark. The machine was not sending its functionaries. It was sending a messenger. The game had not ended. It had simply changed its shape, becoming more intimate, and infinitely more dangerous.

## **CHAPTER 10**

The fire in the hearth of the cottage was not for warmth. It was a focal point, a contained and useful heat. Alistair MacAulay sat before it, the phone’s receiver still warm in his hand from the call that had ended a minute before, or an hour. Time in the listening dark had a different texture. The voice of the Opposition Leader, Jonathan Thorne, was not an echo in the room, but a change in its pressure. A reasonable voice. A voice that spoke of cliff edges and the folly of crowds. It was the most dangerous kind of voice, because it made you want to agree.

He had not agreed. He had listened. He had said, “Talk is what we do in the light, Jonathan. In committees. With clerks taking notes.” And Thorne, with a sigh that was either theatrical or profoundly weary, had said, “The light is where the cameras are, Alistair. The light is where we perform. The edge of the cliff is in the dark. Come and look at it with me.”

They had settled on a place. Not London. Not Edinburgh. A neutral piece of Britain, stripped of symbolism: a private room in the Station Hotel, Perth. Tomorrow. The banality of it was its own disguise.

MacAulay placed a peat brick on the fire. It hissed, releasing a scent of ancient bog and slow time. *A messenger*, he had thought. Not a functionary. The machine was learning. It was offering him a hand, not to pull him back, but to step with him onto new, untested ground. The forge-glow inside him banked, considering the new metal being offered. It would be soft, political. It would require a different kind of hammer.

***

The dawn came not with colour, but with a gradual leaching of the black from the sky, leaving the hills the colour of cold slate. Catriona arrived as he was finishing his coffee, the Land Rover’s engine cutting through the silence like a seam ripper. She brought the cold in with her, and the smell of diesel and sheep.

“Perth?” she said, hanging her waxed jacket on the back of the door. She didn’t look at him, busying herself with the kettle. “He wants to meet in Perth? It’s like choosing a layby for a duel.”

“It’s a place people pass through,” MacAulay said. “It doesn’t hold memory. That’s the point.”

She turned, leaning against the sink. Her face was sharp in the morning light. “The point is he’s offering you a private conversation. No minutes. No advisors. That’s not an olive branch. That’s a transaction where the currency hasn’t been named yet.”

“I know.”

“Do you?” She pushed off from the sink, coming to stand by the table. “You won. You drew your line. The wall’s rebuilt. The press is calling you the ‘Drystone Democrat’. The party’s polling numbers are up for the first time in a decade. The machine is rattled. So it changes tactic. It doesn’t send Sir Jeremy to bludgeon you. It sends Thorne to *understand* you. To find the price of you.”

He looked into his cup. The dregs were black, settled. “And what’s your assessment of my price, Chief of Staff?”

It was the first time he’d used her title in weeks. She heard the shift. Her eyes narrowed, not in hurt, but in professional calibration. “I think you don’t have one. Not in pounds or promises. But you have a weight. The weight of responsibility. They’ll try to make you carry something for them. Something that seems light, reasonable. A compromise on the fisheries bill. A softening of the land reform language. A shared committee on… I don’t know, rural connectivity. It will be a stone they hand you. And once it’s in your pocket, you’ll find it’s tied to a thousand other stones.”

Her words were a clear, cold stream running over the facts. She was right. This was the practical consequence of his victory: not rest, but a more complex battlefield. The defiant fire on the hillside had to become a strategy in a panelled room.

“I need you to do something for me,” he said.
“Anything.”
“I need you to be wrong.”
She was silent.
“I need there to be a possibility,” he continued, “that Thorne is just a man who sees the cliff edge. That the machine is not a single entity, but a thing that can be… redirected. If I go in there seeing only the trap, I will learn nothing. I will become a stone myself. Unmoved and useless.”

Catriona sat down slowly. She studied his face as if reading a map of unfamiliar terrain. “You’re not going to negotiate. You’re going to… reconnoitre.”
“I’m going to listen. On my own.”
“That’s a risk.”
“It is.”
She nodded, once. A conclusion reached. “Then my job is to prepare for every version of you that comes back. The one who makes a deal. The one who walks away. The one who…” She trailed off.
“The one who is changed,” he finished. “Yes.”

It was a re-evaluation, not of their relationship, but of its parameters. She was not his conscience, nor his shield. She was his strategist, and a strategist must plan for the evolution of her principal. There was a grace in the conclusion, a mutual unclenching. Some fights were not between people, but between the roles they had to play.

“I’ll hold the fort,” she said, her voice returning to its practical tone. “The press will want a line. ‘Constructive dialogue in the national interest’?”
“Too warm. ‘Exploratory conversations.’ Keep it cold.”
“Cold,” she agreed. She stood to leave, then paused. “Alistair. The weight of the stone in your hand. You know its outcome. Throw it, or don’t. In that hotel room… what if the choice isn’t to throw, but to accept a stone from *his* hand? To carry it for him?”

He had no answer. She saw that, and let herself out. The cottage felt larger after she left, the silence not listening, but waiting.

***

The Station Hotel had the weary grandeur of a once-grand dame now hosting commercial travellers. The carpets were deep, patterned to hide stains; the air smelled of polish and distant frying. MacAulay was shown to a room called the ‘Caledonian Suite’, which was a small parlour with a view of the car park and a watercolour of a loch that never existed.

Jonathan Thorne was already there, standing at the empty fireplace. He was a tall man, built like a retired rower, with the kind of handsome, lined face that spoke of earnest concern. He wore a tweed jacket that was just the right side of shabby, a calculated contrast to Sir Jeremy’s metropolitan gloss. He turned as MacAulay entered, and his smile was immediate, devoid of triumph or supplication.

“Alistair. Thank you for coming.” No title. An assumption of parity that was both a compliment and a land-grab.
“Jonathan. You picked a temple of atmosphere.”
Thorne’s laugh was a short, genuine bark. “It’s awful, isn’t it? Perfectly awful. No one we know would be caught dead here. Sit, please.”

There was a tray with a pot of coffee, two cups. No whisky. This was not a social call. MacAulay took a chair, its upholstery sighing beneath him. Thorne remained standing, leaning on the mantelpiece, a man playing at ease.

“I’ll be direct,” Thorne began. “We’re in a mess. You have your wall, and the moral high ground that comes with it. My backbenchers are calling for your head on a pike. Your backbenchers are dreaming of a border poll. The markets are jittery. The commentary is all about fracture.” He paused, letting the bleak inventory hang. “But you and I, we’re not backbenchers. We’re not commentators. We have to govern the pieces, even if we’re holding different ones.”

“I’m listening,” MacAulay said, his voice neutral.

“The Prime Minister is… fatigued. The party is restless. There is a view—a growing view—that the current posture is unsustainable. That a new settlement is required.” Thorne chose his words like a man selecting tools. “Not independence. Not a reversal. But a formalisation. A written framework for the powers you have, and the ones you want. A constitution within a constitution. Stability. Predictability.”

It was a breathtaking offer. It was the Holy Grail of devolution: permanence, recognition, a lock on the glass case of the Union. It was everything his party had argued for abstractly for decades. Handed to him, in a drab Perth hotel room, by his political opposite.

MacAulay felt the weight of it. Not a stone. A cornerstone. “In return for what?”
Thorne spread his hands. “Peace. A public commitment to the permanence of the Union. A joint front on… certain economic realities. A end to the constant constitutional guerilla war. You get your secure foundation. We get a stable United Kingdom. The people get government, not grandstanding.”

It was so reasonable. So clean. It was the cliff edge, and Thorne was offering to build a sturdy fence, together. MacAulay looked past him, out at the rain beginning to streak the car park. It was Scottish rain here, earnest and straight.

“You’re offering me a cage,” MacAulay said, quietly. “A very well-built, respectable cage. With my name on the deed.”
Thorne’s affable mask didn’t slip, but it stilled. “I’m offering you a legacy. A chance to move on from the eternal argument to the actual work. Isn’t that what you want? To care for your piece of the earth? This would let you do that, without looking over your shoulder.”

*And there it is*, MacAulay thought. The price. They had seen his victory not as a threat, but as a revelation. They had seen the man who rebuilt a wall with his own hands, and they thought they understood him. They thought he was a man who just wanted to be left alone to tend his garden. They would give him the deed to the garden, and in taking it, he would acknowledge it was part of their estate.

The forge-glow inside him stirred, not with fury, but with a cold, clarifying heat. This was the key decision. Not about tactics, but about essence. To accept would be to corrupt the very power he had won—the power of unmediated responsibility. It would be to trade the vast, listening dark for the fluorescent hum of a secured office.

“You mistake me, Jonathan,” MacAulay said, his voice low and even. “I don’t want to be left alone. I want to be *responsible*. There’s a difference. Being left alone is a privilege someone grants. Responsibility is a thing you take. You’re offering me a grant. With conditions.”

Thorne straightened. The friendly pretence was thinning. “All power has conditions, Alistair. Even the power you took on that hillside. You think the people who cheered you wouldn’t turn if you couldn’t fill their supermarkets? If the money stopped? I’m offering you the tools to do the job properly.”
“You’re offering me a better harness. I’m not interested in harnesses anymore.”
“Then what *are* you interested in?” Thorne’s patience was wearing. The Leader of the Opposition was appearing, beneath the reasonable man.

MacAulay stood. He felt the height difference, but it wasn’t about physicality. It was about vantage. “I’m interested in the truth of the line. My line. Not one you agree to in a document. The one I draw because I believe it’s right to draw it. You want stability? You can have it. Don’t try to buy my silence. Earn it. By listening. By respecting the line, even when you hate it.”

Thorne looked at him for a long moment, a surgeon realising the patient has refused the life-saving operation. There was pity in his eyes now, and a flicker of contempt. “You’re making a poet’s error, Alistair. Mistaking a gesture for a government. They will break you for this. Not with a fight, but with a slow, grinding indifference. You’ll be a footnote. A man who chose a pile of stones over a place at the table.”

MacAulay moved to the door. He felt lighter, not with triumph, but with a terrible clarity. “I’ve seen the table, Jonathan. I know how they build the chairs. I prefer the hill.”

He left the man standing by the empty fireplace, in a room that smelled of other people’s compromises. In the corridor, the air felt cleaner, colder. He had not shattered expectations. He had refused to let them be set for him. The corruption of power was not in its use, but in its acceptance as a gift from the wrong hands.

***

The drive back north was a slow immersion into a gathering storm. The sky bruised, purpling from the east. By the time he turned off the main road towards the glen, the first flakes of snow were mixing with the rain, hesitant scouts before the main army.

He found he was not thinking of Thorne, or the offer, or the future. He was thinking of the wall. It would be under snow now. The lines of it softened, but its presence undeniable beneath the blanket. A state of careful, watched repair. It would need checking after this. Some stones might have shifted in the freeze.

He parked at the cottage and walked out to it, the snow catching in his hair, melting on the shoulders of his coat. In the near-dark, the world was reduced to monochrome: the white of the falling snow, the black of the stone, the grey of everything else. He placed a hand on the cold, wet rock. It was steady.

The hook was not in the phone call, or the meeting. It was in the silence that followed a refused offer. The machine would not rage. It would recalibrate. Thorne had been a probe, a test of his price. The test had failed. They would now categorise him not as an opponent to be bargained with, but as a force to be contained by other means. More intimate. More dangerous. He had made himself not a player in their game, but the definition of the board itself. They would have to change the game entirely.

He heard a car engine, straining on the track. Not Catriona’s Land Rover. A lower, smoother sound. Headlights cut through the swirling snow, painting the wall in brief, stark relief before sweeping over him and stopping.

The driver’s door opened. A figure emerged, silhouetted against the light. Not Sir Jeremy. Not a messenger.

It was the Prime Minister.

She wore a dark coat, no hat, her hair quickly dusted with white. She looked small against the vastness of the glen, and utterly out of place. She did not approach, simply stood by her car, looking at him standing by his wall.

The snow fell between them, a curtain of quiet.

MacAulay did not move. He waited, his hand still on the stone. The forge inside him burned steady, ready for the new, unexpected metal. She had not sent a functionary, or a messenger, or even the Opposition. She had come herself, after dark, in a snowstorm. The game had not just changed its shape. It had left the table entirely and followed him home.

She took one step forward, then another, her shoes crunching on the frozen ground. She stopped a few yards away, her face pale in the gloom. When she spoke, her voice was stripped of its usual parliamentary resonance, thin and carried away on the wind.

“You wouldn’t take his fence,” she said. It wasn’t a question.

“No.”
She nodded, as if this confirmed something profound and disappointing. She looked past him, at the wall disappearing into the snowy dark. “Then we have a problem, Alistair. Because I can’t go back empty-handed.”

She met his eyes. In hers, he saw not threat, but a desperate, weary calculation. She was not here as the Prime Minister. She was here as the last gambit. The final, personal appeal before the mechanisms of state, untethered from politics, began to turn.

The snow settled on them both. Two figures in a vast, white silence, with a line of stone between them.

# Chapter 11

## **CHAPTER 11**

The snow on the collar of the Prime Minister’s coat was not Westminster snow. It was a Highland snow, dry and granular, a bitter dust that stung the eyes and leached the warmth from words before they could be spoken. It did not settle on the city’s grime, but on ancient rock, on frozen heather, on the line of stone that stood between them. Alistair MacAulay watched it gather in the dark folds of her wool. He was thinking about the weight of a government, the cold, intricate machinery of it. A weight that promised no simple outcome, only consequence layered upon consequence.

“You can’t go back empty-handed,” he repeated, his voice low, absorbed by the falling quiet. “But you came here knowing I wouldn’t give you what you came for. So what you’re holding isn’t a hand. It’s a bucket. And you need me to fill it with something else.”

Prime Minister Eleanor Vance did not flinch. The wind plucked at her hair, a few strands of grey against the black. The carefully curated resilience she wore in the Commons chamber was gone, packed away for the journey north. What remained was the fatigue of perpetual calculation, the face of someone who has run out of moves on the prescribed board.

“They are going to invoke the Reserve Powers,” she said. The words were flat, factual. A weather report for a coming storm. “Jeremy’s memo was the final piece. They have the precedent. They have the ‘clear and present danger to the economic union’ clause. It’s no longer a political discussion, Alistair. It’s a constitutional tripwire. And you put your foot on it.”

MacAulay’s hand was still on the stone of the wall. The cold bit through his skin, a grounding ache. “He sent you the memo before he sent it to me.”

“Of course he did. He’s the Permanent Secretary to the Treasury, not to you.” She said it without malice, a simple statement of the universe’s order. “His duty is to the integrity of the whole. You are currently a threat to that integrity. Therefore, his duty is to contain you.”

The forge inside MacAulay banked, not with anger, but with a cold clarity. This was the true shape of the thing. Not a debate, not a negotiation. An administrative quarantine. “And you? What’s your duty tonight? To deliver the prognosis in person?”

Vance looked away, over the glen, a vast bowl of darkness and swirling white. “My duty is to prevent it. Once they pull that lever, it’s out of my hands. Out of anyone’s hands. It becomes a legal and security operation. The ‘Smooth Transition Protocol’.” She gave the official title a sour twist. “Your government would be bypassed. Your legislation frozen. Your authority… politely ignored, while Whitehall ‘assists’ with stability.”

“A coup with a glossary,” MacAulay said.

“A coup with a hundred years of legal varnish,” she corrected. “And once it starts, I can’t stop it. Neither can you. The only way out is to not let it start.” She finally took a step closer, until the toe of her city shoe almost touched the rough base of the wall. “Give me something, Alistair. Something I can take back. A delay. A consultation. A bloody commission of enquiry. Something with a title dull enough to make them pause.”

He understood then. She wasn’t the Prime Minister threatening him. She was a Prime Minister begging for a tool to keep her own government, her own system, from eating itself. The desperation in her eyes was real. It was the fear of a keeper seeing the locks on the cages click open, one by one.

“You want me to give you a fence,” he said, “so you can pretend I’ve agreed to be in your field.”

“I want you to give me a *pause*,” she insisted, her breath a pale cloud. “Time to work this through the proper channels. To find a compromise.”

“There is no compromise between a lock and a key, Eleanor. Only a function.” He lifted his hand from the stone, flexing the cold from his fingers. “You can’t pause a tripwire. You can only step off it, or trigger it.”

Her shoulders slumped, a minute surrender to the cold and the impossibility. “Then it’s done. They’ll make the call tomorrow. Probably while you’re in the air back to Edinburgh.”

The snow fell between them, a silent, accumulating verdict.

“No,” MacAulay said.

She looked up, a flicker of hope, instantly wary. “No?”

“They won’t make the call tomorrow.” He turned and began to walk along the line of the wall, back towards the cottage. After a moment, he heard the crunch of her steps following, hesitant, through the drifts.

“Why not?”

“Because you’re going to tell them I’ve agreed to a meeting. Not a commission. A meeting. In Edinburgh. With you, and the Deputy PM, and the Chancellor. And Sir Jeremy Cathcart.”

She stopped. “That’s just a different room, Alistair. It changes nothing.”

He kept walking, his voice trailing back to her on the wind. “It changes the venue. And the venue is the message. You come to me. On my ground. You tell them that. It’s not a concession, it’s a logistical necessity. The First Minister’s schedule is… congested.” He reached the cottage door and turned. She was a pale, hesitant shape in the gloom. “It will take them forty-eight hours to arrange the security, the travel, the briefings. Forty-eight hours where the tripwire is still armed, but everyone’s too busy planning the catering to pull it.”

Vance stared at him, reassessing. The man in front of her was no longer just the stubborn Scot at the wall. He was using their own machinery, their own love of process, as a wedge. “And what happens at this meeting? You just say no again, to our faces, with minutes taken?”

MacAulay pushed the cottage door open. Warm, peat-scented light spilled out, cutting a yellow wedge into the night. “What happens at the meeting,” he said, “is my business. Your business is to sell them the delay. Can you do that?”

She stood on the threshold, between the cold wilderness and the warm interior, a woman perpetually on a threshold. He saw the calculation return, sharper now. She was weighing his offer—not for the nation, but for her own survival. A delay was a lifeline. It gave her time to manoeuvre, to distance herself, to find a narrative.

“Yes,” she said, finally. “I can do that.”

“Then come in,” he said. “You can use the phone. The signal’s a bastard here, but it works by the east window. Tell them you’ve had productive talks. Use those words. ‘Productive talks’. It means nothing, and they’ll hear everything they want to hear.”

***

**Scene 2**

The Prime Minister’s car, a discreet Jaguar with government plates, vanished into the snow an hour later, its tail lights swallowed by the shifting white. MacAulay watched from the window until the dark and the weather claimed it entirely. The silence it left behind was different. It was no longer an empty silence, but a charged one, like the air before a lightning strike.

He moved to the old pine table, clearing away the remnants of a solitary supper. His mind was not on Vance, nor on the meeting he had just invented. It was on a loose end, a frayed thread from the central conflict that had just pulled taut.

The phone call had come just after Vance left. Catriona, her voice tight with a controlled fury.

“It’s Donnan,” she’d said, no greeting. “The factor. He’s at the Crofters’ Hall in Kilmarnoch. Called an ‘emergency meeting’ of the tenancy board. Telling them the estate’s financial position is untenable. Hinting at a buyer. A *single* buyer, for the whole glen.”

MacAulay had felt the old, familiar heat rise—the impotent anger of the tenant’s son watching the laird’s man do his work. But it was followed immediately by a cold, settling certainty. This was no coincidence. Sir Jeremy’s hand was in this, a subtle pressure applied to a remote, vulnerable point. A reminder that the machinery of containment had many small, sharp gears. It was a message: *We can reach anywhere. Even here.*

“I’m on my way,” he’d said.

“Alistair, you can’t. It’s a local matter, and you’re the—”

“I’m the First Minister. And tonight, I’m a constituent with a question for his factor.”

Now, driving Catriona’s Land Rover down the treacherous track towards Kilmarnoch, the windscreen wipers beating a frantic rhythm, he tested the new weight of his status. It was a tool, like any other. It could be a blunt instrument, or a precise one. He had spent a lifetime distrusting it, seeing it as a foreign metal. Now, he needed to wield it, not as a politician, but as a man who understood the specific pressure point of a place like this.

The Crofters’ Hall was a low, white-harled building, lights blazing against the early dark. A dozen vehicles were parked haphazardly outside, old pickups and mud-spattered cars. Inside, the air was thick with damp wool, woodsmoke, and tension. About twenty men and women were gathered, some on folding chairs, others standing against the walls. They were the tenants of the Glencorragh estate, faces he had known since childhood: MacLeods, Macraes, Frasers. Their faces, etched by wind and work, were turned towards the front of the hall, where Finlay Donnan stood beside a flip chart.

Donnan was a thin, precise man in a waxed jacket and brogues, an import from the south who managed the land as a spreadsheet. He was in mid-flow, a pointer in his hand resting on a column of red figures.

“—simply not sustainable. The roof repairs on the home farm alone are a six-figure sum. The subsidy landscape is changing, and without significant diversification, which requires capital, the estate is bleeding value. My duty is to the trustees, to preserve the asset.”

“Your duty is to the land, and the folk on it,” came a voice from the back. Old Iain MacLeod, his father’s contemporary. “That was the arrangement.”

“The arrangement,” Donnan said, with a patient, condescending smile, “is a legal document. And it allows for the sale of assets if the financial viability is threatened. I’m not talking about evictions. I’m talking about a fresh start, with an investor who has the vision and the capital to secure the future of the glen.”

“What investor?” Catriona asked. She was standing to the side, arms crossed. “What’s the name?”

“Confidentiality, Dr. MacAulay, at this stage. But I can say they are a reputable, conservation-minded entity. They see the long-term potential.”

The door opened behind MacAulay, letting in a blast of cold air and snow. Heads turned. Conversations died. Donnan’s pointer froze mid-air.

All eyes tracked MacAulay as he walked into the hall. He shed his coat slowly, hanging it on a peg by the door. He did not go to the front. He simply found an empty space against the wall, near the old, pot-bellied stove, and leaned there. He said nothing.

His presence was a stone dropped into the pond. The ripples were silence, then a low murmur. Donnan’s confidence faltered for a second, his eyes darting from MacAulay to his flip chart and back.

“First Minister,” Donnan said, recovering, his voice artificially bright. “An unexpected honour. We’re just having a rather mundane discussion about estate business.”

“I heard,” MacAulay said, his voice calm, carrying in the quiet room. “Heard you talking about viability. About assets.” He pushed himself off the wall and took a few steps into the centre of the space, not towards Donnan, but towards the people. “My father rented the Corragh Moor parcel from this estate for forty-seven years. He taught me that viability wasn’t a number on a page. It was whether you could mend a fence with the wood to hand. Whether the spring didn’t run dry. Whether your neighbour would help you bring in the sheep before a storm.” He looked at Donnan. “You mentioned a conservation-minded entity. That’s good. I’m minded to conserve this.” He gestured to the room, to the people in it. “And I’ve just had a very productive talk with the Prime Minister about the importance of stable, sustainable communities in our national fabric. She was particularly interested in models of community land ownership.”

He let the words hang. A lie, wrapped in a truth. He had mentioned no such thing to Vance. But the connection was made, glittering and dangerous, in the air between him and the factor.

Donnan paled. “Community buy-out? That’s… a lengthy, uncertain process. The trustees would never—”

“The trustees,” MacAulay interrupted, his voice still quiet, “will consider all viable options. Especially those that might attract… sympathetic attention. And funding. From a government suddenly very keen on demonstrating its commitment to local empowerment.” He took another step, now close enough to see the sheen of sweat on Donnan’s temple. “You should inform your confidential investor, Finlay. Tell them the glen is now a matter of high political interest. Tell them the First Minister is taking a personal interest in its future. That tends to change the… due diligence process.”

It was a naked, brutal use of power. Not a policy, not a law. A shadow, cast from a great height. The threat was unspoken but crystalline: *Proceed, and you proceed under a spotlight I control.*

The tenants watched, a new, hard understanding in their eyes. They saw not their neighbour’s boy, but the office he held, and how he had just turned its glare on their behalf.

Donnan’s mouth opened, then closed. The flip chart with its red figures seemed suddenly ridiculous, a child’s drawing. The meeting was over. He knew it. The power in the room had shifted, as decisively and silently as a stone settling into a new place in a wall.

“I’ll… convey the sentiment,” Donnan managed, beginning to gather his papers with unsteady hands.

MacAulay gave a small, cold nod. “See that you do.” He turned back to the tenants, the weight of the status he’d used feeling both alien and right. “I’ll have my office send over the relevant information on community right-to-buy legislation. Catriona can coordinate.”

He didn’t wait for a response. He retrieved his coat and walked back out into the snow. The loose end was tied, not with consensus, but with the stark, clean knot of protected interest. It was the first time he had used his position not as a representative, but as a shield and a weapon. The forge glowed with a fierce, unambiguous light. This, it said, was what the metal was for.

***

**Scene 3**

He did not go back to the cottage. The energy from the hall was a live wire in his blood, incompatible with the quiet of the hearth. He drove instead to the far end of the glen, to a place where the road dwindled to a track and the track to a path, and the path was lost under the snow.

He walked the last half-mile, the beam of his torch cutting a frail tunnel through the dark. The snow had eased to a few drifting flakes. The clouds tore open in patches, revealing a hard, cold scatter of stars. His destination was a shape against the lighter dark of the sky: the ruins of the old shepherd’s bothy where he had been born.

It was not a picturesque ruin. It was a low, gutted shell of rough stone, the roof long gone, the interior open to the sky. A few charred timbers lay where the hearth had been. He stood in what had been the doorway, the torchlight playing over the snow-dusted rubble. This was the personal remnant. The physical echo of the life before the weight of stone, of office, of nation.

He remembered the cold that would seep through the walls, the smell of peat and wet wool, his mother singing a Gaelic lullaby by the fire’s weak light. He remembered his father’s hands, cracked and permanent as stone, teaching him how to lay a first course, the importance of a solid foundation. “Every other stone leans on this one, Ali. Choose it right.”

He had built his life from that foundation. A life of chosen stones, carefully fitted. The scholarship, the law, the party, the ascent. Each one selected for its fit, its contribution to the whole structure. And now he was at the wall in the snow, the foundation stone of his entire existence—this place, this poverty, this silence—feeling like it belonged to a different man.

He stepped inside, his boots crunching on frozen debris. This was the self he was about to confront for the final time. Not the proud son of the soil, but the boy who had desperately wanted to escape the crushing limitation of it. The boy who saw the bothy not as a home, but as a cage of circumstance. All his politics, his fierce, intellectual independence, had been, in part, a long, elaborate reaction against the sheer *smallness* of this place.

He knelt, brushing snow from a piece of fallen lintel. The stone was ice-cold. This was the old self: the one that believed power was something you took *from* a place like this, to ensure you never had to return to it. The one that saw the glen as a backdrop, not a source.

A sound made him look up. A fox stood at the edge of the torchlight, a brush of red and white, its eyes catching the beam like chips of green glass. It regarded him without fear, this man in its territory, then turned and trotted silently into the night, leaving only delicate paw-prints in the new snow.

The closure came not as a dramatic realisation, but as a quiet settling. He was not that boy anymore. He had not taken power *from* this place. He had carried its weight *with* him. The cold certainty of the stone, the patience of the wall, the unyielding line against the weather. These were not things he had escaped; they were the things that had shaped him. The bothy was not a cage he had fled. It was the quarry.

He would not rebuild it. He would not romanticise it. He would let it be a ruin, a marker in the landscape of his life. The old self was not an enemy to be defeated, but a ghost to be acknowledged and left behind. The man who walked out of here tonight would do so not in rejection, but in full, unflinching possession of the path that led from this doorway to the First Minister’s car, and to the wall in the snow where a Prime Minister had come to beg.

He stood, his knees cracking in the cold. He took one last look around the shell, then switched off his torch. In the sudden, profound dark, under the indifferent stars, the bothy was just a shape. A memory in stone. He turned and walked back towards the road, his own footprints the only proof he had been there at all.

***

**Scene 4**

The light was on in Catriona’s cottage window, a warm, squared invitation in the vast dark. He knocked the snow from his boots and let himself in.

She was at her kitchen table, maps and geological survey reports spread out before her, a half-drunk mug of tea gone cold at her elbow. She looked up, her face tired but alert.

“I heard you scattered Donnan’s meeting like starlings,” she said. There was no praise in it, just assessment.

“I used a title as a cudgel,” he replied, hanging his coat. “It felt… effective. And dirty.”

“It’s a dirty business, saving a place,” she said, pushing a report away. “So. You’ve tied the loose end. You’ve played the big man from Edinburgh. You’ve communed with your past. What now?”

He sat down opposite her, the old wood of the chair familiar. “Now I need your help.”

“To do what?”

“To begin a journey you should have started years ago.” He reached out and tapped the topographical map of the glen. “The community buy-out. You’re going to lead it.”

She laughed, a short, surprised sound. “Me? I’m a geologist, Alistair. I look at rocks, not balance sheets.”

“You understand what’s underneath,” he said, his voice intense. “You understand the foundation. The others will follow you. Old Iain respects you. The young Macraes listen to you. You’re of this place, but you see its future. You’re not fighting the past, you’re looking for what comes next.”

She studied him, her scepticism softening into curiosity. “And what will you do? Issue a decree?”

“I’ll make a phone call. To the National Fund for Community Land Purchase. I’ll tell them the First Minister is personally endorsing the Glencorragh application. That it’s a model project. That will get you to the front of the queue. It will get you the advisors, the legal help, the seed funding.” He leaned forward. “But after that, Cat, it’s yours. Your committee. Your plan. Your vision. Not a museum. A living place. You decide if it’s rewilding, or sustainable farming, or both. You decide the future.”

He saw it dawn on her, not as a gift, but as a burden and a possibility so vast it was terrifying. This was the true closure. Not for him, but for the glen. He was using his new, hard-won, corruptible power not to control it, but to set it free. To give it the tools to define itself, so he would never have to be its saviour again.

“You’re handing it off,” she whispered.

“I’m giving it a start. The first stone.” He echoed his father’s words. “Every other stone will lean on it. Choose it right.”

Tears glittered in her eyes, not of sentiment, but of fierce, daunting recognition. She looked down at the map, at the contours of the home she loved. “It’s a hell of a stone.”

“It is.” He stood up. “I have to go back to Edinburgh. The Prime Minister is coming for a meeting.”

“The one you invented.”

“The one I invented.” He moved to the door. “When they come for you with the paperwork, you’ll be ready?”

She looked up, and the girl he’d known was gone, replaced by a woman stepping into a new shape. “Aye,” she said. “We’ll be ready.”

He nodded, and stepped back out into the night. The snow had stopped. The clouds had cleared entirely, and a three-quarter moon, sharp as a scythe, cast a blue-white light over the glen. It lit the long, unbroken line of the drystane dyke, running over the shoulder of the hill like a seam of silver.

He drove slowly back to his cottage. The forge inside him was quiet now, the fire banked but ready. He had attended to the loose end. He had used his status. He had buried the ghost. He had passed on the first stone.

As he parked and walked to the door, he saw something on the step. Not a package. A single, white envelope, pristine against the dark stone. No stamp. No address. Just his name, typed.

He picked it up, his fingers cold. Inside, a single sheet of thick, cream paper.

It was not from the government. It was not from the party.

It was a summons.

*You are requested to attend, at a time and place to be specified, to provide clarification on matters pertaining to the integrity of the Scottish Government’s financial protocols. Under the terms of the Ministerial Code, your attendance is required as a witness of fact.*

It was signed by the name of the independent auditor general for Scotland. An office created by his own government’s legislation. A mechanism of accountability he himself had voted into existence.

Sir Jeremy Cathcart had not been idle. He had not waited for the Reserve Powers. He had simply activated a smaller, sharper, more precise mechanism within the machine. One that did not target the nation, but the man. One that used Alistair MacAulay’s own tools, his own laws, his own principles, against him.

The game had not left the table. It had simply moved to a different room, one with rules he had written himself. He looked up from the paper, across the moon-washed glen, towards the invisible line of the wall. The metal was coming to the forge again. But this time, it was his own.

# Chapter 12

## **CHAPTER 27**

The rain on the window of the First Minister’s car was not London rain. It was a hard, honest Scottish downpour, needling the loch, pocking the dark water into a shifting grey sheet. Alistair MacAulay watched it stream and merge on the glass. He was thinking about the weight of the envelope in his hand, the cold, certain fact of it. A weight that promised no simple outcome. Only the long, intricate labour of answering for one thing with another. Not a stone. Never a stone. A thread, pulled, that might yet unravel the whole tapestry he had woven.

He was not in the official car. He was in his own, an old Volvo estate, parked on the gravel sweep outside the cottage. The summons lay on the passenger seat. He had read it a dozen times. *Clarification. Integrity. Witness of fact.* The language was a drystane dyke of its own, each word a smooth, fitted term of art, designed to bear weight and exclude the weather of emotion. Sir Jeremy Cathcart was a mason of such language. He had built a trap from the very stones of Alistair’s own house.

“You’re quiet, Dad.”

The voice from the back seat was not polished, not neutral. It was Isla’s, softened by concern, sharpened by a new, hard-won understanding. She had come up from Edinburgh when he’d called. Not to strategise, but to be there. To see him off.

“Aye,” he said, not turning from the window. “Just thinking. It’s a different kind of journey back.”

“It’s not a surrender,” she said, the words a statement, a question.

“No,” he agreed. “A surrender is simple. This is… accounting. The most corrosive form of politics. Not a battle of wills, but a forensic of receipts. He’s not trying to break me with a hammer. He’s trying to bury me in salt.”

He finally turned. She was leaning forward, her arms on the back of his seat. Her mother’s eyes in a face that had shed its last traces of girlishness over these last months. She had seen the machinery up close. She had felt its heat.

“You wrote the Ministerial Code,” she said.

“I did.”

“You appointed the auditor general.”

“I did.”

“Then use your tools.”

He smiled, a thin, tired thing. “That’s the forge talking. But the law isn’t a hammer. It’s a set of blueprints. And Cathcart has found a discrepancy in the foundation. My foundation.” He tapped the summons. “This isn’t about the Reserve Powers. It’s better. It’s cleaner. If he can establish impropriety—a diverted grant, a favour for a donor, any whiff of personal gain from a public policy—he discredits not just the policy, but the man behind it. The man who built the system. The corruption isn’t in the act, Isla. It’s in the perception. And perception is a tide. Once it turns, it drowns everything.”

He saw her absorb it, the cynical brilliance of it. To use his own integrity as the weapon. The ultimate corruption: turning virtue against itself.

“What will you do?”

He looked past her, through the rear window, up to the hill where the drystane dyke cut across the skyline. “I’ll attend. I’ll clarify. I’ll answer every question. And I will tell the truth.”

“The whole truth?”

“The truth,” he said, “is a drystane dyke. It depends which stone you start with, which you leave out, how you fit them together. My truth is that I acted for Scotland. His truth will be that I bent my own rules to do it. Both are facts. The story is in the mortar between.”

He started the car. The engine was a mundane rumble. No security detail, no outriders. Just a man driving south to give an account of himself.

“Tell Mairi,” he said, “the forge is hers. She’ll know what to do.”

Isla nodded, her throat tight. She got out, standing in the rain as he reversed, turned, and began the drive down the glen road. He watched her in the mirror, a solitary figure growing smaller, then gone around a bend.

***

**Scene 1: The Forge of Self**

The hearing was held not in a grand chamber, but in a committee room on the fifth floor of Victoria Quay, the Scottish Government building in Edinburgh. The windows looked out over a rain-blurred Firth of Forth. The room was overheated, smelling of old paper, industrial cleaner, and a faint, persistent damp.

Alistair sat at a simple table, facing a raised dais where three people sat: the auditor general, Sir Jeremy Cathcart, in the centre; a severe woman from the Treasury on his right; a quietly watchful QC on his left. A stenographer sat to the side, her fingers poised. There were fewer than ten people in the public gallery. This was designed to be dull, administrative, deadly.

Cathcart began without preamble. His voice was as Alistair remembered: precise, bloodless, a perfectly calibrated instrument.

“First Minister, thank you for attending. This panel is convened under Section 14 of the Public Finance and Accountability (Scotland) Act, to examine the allocation and oversight of the Strategic Innovation Fund in the last financial year. Specifically, the award of a £4.2 million grant to the Anvil Advanced Materials Foundry, in your constituency. You declared a conflict of interest, as the founder, Mairi MacLeod, is a personal acquaintance. The award was approved nonetheless, following a ministerial direction you signed. Can you talk us through your reasoning?”

Alistair took a sip of water. The weight was here now, in this room. Not the stone, but the ledger.

“Ms. MacLeod is an acquaintance. She is also the foremost expert in precision-cast, lightweight alloys in the country. Her foundry was the only facility capable of delivering the component we needed for the Green Atlantic wind project. The ministerial direction was to expedite a process that was, in my judgement, being slow-walked by the civil service. The need was strategic. The declaration was made. The process, while accelerated, was followed.”

“Followed,” Cathcart repeated, making the word a question. “Paragraph 7.3 of the Ministerial Code states that in cases of declared interest, the minister must recuse themselves entirely from the decision-making chain. You did not. You intervened.”

“I directed. The Code also allows for ministerial direction in matters of urgent national interest.”

“And who defines ‘urgent national interest’?”

“The minister,” Alistair said. “That is the point of ministerial responsibility. To judge, and to be held accountable for that judgement.”

“A circular logic,” Cathcart noted softly. “You judge the need, you act to meet it, and you cite the need as your justification. Where does the corruption of that power begin, First Minister? At what point does the national interest become indistinguishable from your own interest—in a project, in a constituency, in a friend?”

The question hung in the stuffy air. It was the core of it. Not the act, but the slope.

“Corruption,” Alistair said, “begins in the dark. It begins when you hide the interest, when you bury the direction, when you fear the ledger. I declared. I directed. It is all in the light. You may disagree with my judgement. That is politics. But to mistake a hard judgement for a corrupt one is to misunderstand power entirely. Power is the ability to make the judgement in the first place. The corruption is in pretending you have no choice.”

He saw the QC’s eyebrows lift slightly. Cathcart’s expression did not change.

“Let us examine another stone in the wall,” Cathcart said, moving to the next document. “The planning permission for the associated access road to the foundry, which was called in by your office…”

The questioning went on for two hours. It was a meticulous, relentless examination of the mortar between his actions. Every expedited process, every borderline judgement call, every time he had used the weight of his office to push something through. Cathcart was brilliant. He painted not a picture of blatant theft, but of a gradual, insidious shaping of the apparatus of state to the will of one man. A bending. A warping. The corruption of incremental advantage, justified each time by a greater good.

And Alistair answered, fully, frankly. He did not plead ignorance. He did not hide behind officials. He claimed each decision as his own. He felt a strange clarity settling over him. This was the reckoning. This was the cost of the stone he had chosen not to throw in London, the cost of all the smaller, more complex stones he had lifted and placed since. Power was not just about moving others; it was about being moved by your own choices, into a shape you might not have foreseen.

At the end, Cathcart sat back. “You have been remarkably candid, First Minister.”

“You asked for facts. I have given them. The interpretation is your job.”

“Indeed. This panel will deliberate and issue its findings. Thank you for your time.”

As Alistair stood, his legs stiff, he felt not defeated, but hollowed out. Scoured. He had stood in the forge of his own making, and the bellows had been worked by another. The metal of his reputation had been heated, hammered, and now lay on the anvil, waiting for the final stamp.

***

**Scene 2: The Horizon of the Possible**

He did not return to Bute House. He walked. The Edinburgh rain was a mist now, a haar rolling in from the sea, swallowing the castle, blurring the lines of the Old and New Towns. He walked down to Holyrood, past the parliament building—his parliament, the one he had fought to establish, a building whose very design was meant to speak of transparency and openness. In the haar, it looked like a shipwreck, angular and stranded.

He thought of the horizon. Not the physical one, lost in grey, but the political one. The future. Cathcart’s report would be a weapon. The opposition would wield it. The press would feast on it. The narrative would solidify: not a villain, but a tragic figure, corrupted by his own certainty, his own power. *He started with principles and ended with shortcuts. He became what he beheld.*

It was a powerful story. Perhaps a true one. Was that the corruption? Not the love of money or the lust for fame, but the addiction to efficacy? The belief that your hands, because they had built so much, were the only ones that could be trusted to hold the tools?

He found himself at the foot of Arthur’s Seat. He began to climb, the path slick underfoot. The physical effort was a relief. The forge inside him was quiet, not banked, but empty. The fire had been used in that committee room, in the steady, calm burn of his testimony.

Near the summit, the haar thinned. He broke through into clear, cold air. The sun was a pale disc, low in the west. Below, the city was still shrouded, a ghost of itself. But to the north, the Firth was a sheet of lead, and beyond, the hills of Fife were sharp and blue. The horizon was there, clear and endless.

He felt no fear looking at it. Only a vast, sober curiosity. He had spent years trying to shape that horizon, to build a nation upon it. Now, he might be forced to step away from the work. And the curious thing was, the horizon remained. It did not need his hands. The nation was not him. The idea was bigger than the man. The corruption lay in the confusion of the two.

A phone vibrated in his pocket. Not his official one. His private mobile. He looked at the screen. A number he didn’t recognise. He answered.

“Alistair.” It was Mairi’s voice, crackling with distance and poor signal. “Isla told me. Are you out?”

“I’m up a hill, Mairi. Literally and metaphorically.”

A short, grim laugh. “Good. Listen. The first batch is ready. The alloy. It’s perfect. Lighter, stronger. It’ll work.”

He closed his eyes. The grant. The foundry. The very thing Cathcart was dissecting. It had borne fruit. A tangible thing in the world, because he had bent a rule.

“That’s good news.”

“It’s because of you,” she said, her voice fierce. “Don’t let them tell you different.”

“They’ll say the ends don’t justify the means, Mairi.”

“Ach,” she spat. “What do ends ever justify except more means? You did a thing. A good thing. It exists. Remember the weight of the stone. You chose to build with it.”

The line crackled and died. He stood holding the dead phone to his ear, then lowered it. She was right. The component existed. The wind turbines would be built. That was a fact, separate from the story in the committee room. Power was the ability to make things exist. And corruption? Perhaps corruption was the story you told yourself to forget the cost, or the story others told to deny the thing’s worth. He had paid the cost. He would not forget it. And he would let no one deny the worth.

He looked at the horizon again, the clear, cold line between earth and sky. He was ready for what came next.

**Scene 3: Passing the Stone**

The report was published three weeks later. It was a masterpiece of damning nuance. It found no personal financial corruption, no illegality. It found a “pattern of ministerial overreach,” a “consistent erosion of procedural safeguards,” and a “concerning conflation of national priority with personal conviction.” It concluded that the First Minister’s actions, while not criminal, had “fallen short of the standards of propriety set out in the Ministerial Code” and had “served to undermine the very structures of accountability he was charged with upholding.”

The political earthquake was immediate. The opposition demanded his resignation. Editorials wrestled with the paradox of the principled autocrat. His party was in turmoil, split between those who saw a necessary warrior being hamstrung by bureaucracy and those who feared the electoral poison of “sleaze.”

Alistair called a cabinet meeting. He saw it in their eyes: the doubt, the calculation, the fear. The corrosion was in the room. Power was leaking from him, not in a torrent, but in a slow, steady seep.

When they were all seated, he did not sit at the head of the table. He remained standing, leaning slightly against the wall by the window.

“You’ve all read it,” he began, his voice quiet. “Cathcart is a fine mason. He has built his case well. He is not wrong.”

A murmur of discomfort went around the table.

“He is not wrong about the facts. I did those things. I pushed, I directed, I expedited. I used the weight of this office as a tool, because I believed the work was too urgent, too important, to wait for the machine to grind its way to the right answer.” He paused, looking at each of them. “That is the temptation of power. Not the grand larceny. The quiet shortcut. The belief that the rules are for others, because you see the destination so clearly. That is how corruption begins. Not with a bang, but with a sigh of impatience.”

The Deputy First Minister, a woman named Elspeth Murray, watched him carefully. “What are you saying, First Minister?”

“I am saying that to fight this report would be to validate its core argument. It would be to say that my judgement is above the system. That way lies the true corruption. The unaccountable man.” He straightened. “I will not do that. I will tender my resignation to the Presiding Officer this afternoon.”

The room erupted. Protests, questions, a few grim nods.

He held up a hand. “This is not a defeat. It is a clarification. The office is not the man. The man must be accountable to the office. I am being held accountable by a mechanism I created. That is a victory for the system, if not for me.”

Elspeth Murray spoke into the settling noise. “And the policy? The Green Atlantic? The constitutional work?”

“It continues. It is not mine. It is Scotland’s. You will lead it, Elspeth. You have a cleaner hand now. Use it.”

He saw the weight settle on her shoulders. The stone was passing. Not the stone of a single, defiant throw, but the stone of daily, grinding responsibility. The stone of the dyke-builder.

After the meeting, as others filed out, sombre, he asked Isla, who had been waiting outside, to come in. He handed her a small, felt-wrapped bundle.

“What is this?”

“Open it.”

She unfolded the cloth. Inside was a heavy, smooth, dark river stone, oval, fitting perfectly in the palm. One side was unremarkable. The other had a single, stark, white quartz vein running through it like a lightning bolt.

“It’s from the burn behind the cottage,” he said. “I’ve had it for years. On my desk. A paperweight.”

She hefted it, feeling its cool density. “It’s just a stone.”

“It is. And it isn’t. It’s a reminder. The weight of a choice. The simplicity of a throw. And the complexity of everything that comes after. The corruption isn’t in the stone, Isla. It’s in the hand that picks it up, and the story the mind tells about why.” He met her gaze. “I’m passing it to you. Not to throw. Just to hold. To remember that power is a tangible thing. It has weight. And it always leaves a mark on the hand that wields it.”

She closed her fingers around it, her knuckles white. She nodded, unable to speak.

“Your mother,” he said, his voice softening. “She understood this. She knew the cost of shaping the world. Love her for that. And forgive me for the marks I’ve left on you.”

He turned and looked out the window. The rain had started again. A soft, persistent Edinburgh rain.

***

**Scene 4: The Unbroken Wall**

He resigned that evening. The statement was brief, devoid of rancour, taking responsibility. He returned to the cottage in the glen as a private citizen. The press camped at the end of the road for two days, then lost interest. The world moved on. Elspeth Murray became First Minister. The Green Atlantic project was approved, using Mairi’s alloy. The negotiations with London entered a new, less volatile phase.

A month after his return, on a morning of frost so thick it feathered every blade of grass and every stone of the dyke with white, he went for a walk. He wore an old waxed jacket and boots. The air was still, brittle, scoured clean.

He walked up to the high pasture, to the long, unbroken line of the drystane dyke. He ran a hand along the top course. The stones were ice-cold, rough, immovable. They had been there before him. They would be there after. Each one chosen, fitted, placed by a hand that saw not just the stone, but the gap it filled, the pressure it bore, the line it continued.

He thought of the stone in Isla’s hand in Edinburgh. He thought of the stones of his career, lifted and placed, some well, some poorly. He thought of Cathcart’s report, another stone in the public wall, a stone of judgement that now shaped the boundary of his legacy.

He was not content, not in a simple way. There was too much undone, too much that might have been. But there was a peace. The peace of the accounted-for. The peace of the man who has stood in the forge of his own making and felt the heat, who has seen his own metal shaped, and who knows its true temper.

The corruption of power was not a monster he had slain. It was a shadow he had carried, that had grown longer as he himself grew taller. He had not escaped it. He had stepped into the light, and let the shadow fall behind him, for all to see.

He looked to the horizon, where the dyke disappeared over the shoulder of the hill. The future was there, unknown. He was no longer the mason. Perhaps he would write. Perhaps he would simply mend this very wall, stone by stone, with no purpose but the work itself. The possibility was open, a clear, cold space.

He turned and began the walk back down to the cottage. The frost was beginning to melt in the weak sun, and the world glittered. As he approached the door, he saw not an envelope, but a single, dark feather caught on the step—a raven’s, perhaps. He picked it up, its vanes soft and perfect in his fingers. A token of nothing. A sign of everything. He smiled, a real smile this time, and went inside.

The rain on the window of the cottage was Scottish rain. It was a steady, patient fall, feeding the earth, filling the burn. Alistair MacAulay watched it trace paths on the glass. He was thinking about the weight of a feather in his hand, the negligible, certain lightness of it. A weight that promised no outcome at all. Just the quiet fact of its existence, and the hand that held it, free now to feel the difference.

# Chapter 13

## **CHAPTER 13**

The feather lay on the kitchen table, a stark comma of black against the pale, scrubbed wood. It was not a memory, but a present fact. Alistair MacAulay sat before it, a cold mug of tea at his elbow, the cottage around him holding its breath in the post-dawn chill. The peace of the accounted-for, so hard-won on the hillside yesterday, felt like a garment he had not yet grown into. It hung on him, strange and slightly too large. The quiet fact of the feather’s existence did not promise serenity. It asked a question he could not yet hear.

The rain had stopped. A low, silver light seeped through the windows, illuminating motes of peat-dust and time. He had slept deeply, the sleep of a man who has confessed, but he had woken to this: the feather, and the silence, and the vast, empty ledger of a day with no meetings to attend, no statements to parse, no Jeremy Cathcart arranging the invisible world into acceptable order.

He reached out and touched the central shaft. It was cool, resilient. A raven’s feather. A carrion bird. A keeper of secrets, a trickster. In another life, in another mood, he might have seen it as an omen. Now, it was just a thing that had landed. The problem was the landing. The problem was what came after the peace.

The knock at the door was not soft. It was three firm, deliberate raps that seemed to vibrate in the old timber of the frame. Not a neighbour’s knock. Not a journalist’s furtive tap. This was a knock that expected to be answered.

MacAulay did not startle. He looked from the feather to the door, his mind performing the old, weary calculus of threat and opportunity. He was a private citizen now. The men in dark cars with earpieces were gone. The risk was his alone. He felt the weight of that, too—a lighter, more personal burden.

He opened the door.

The man on the step was in his late fifties, dressed in a waxed jacket that had seen proper weather, its green darkened at the shoulders. His face was the colour and texture of tanned hide, lined from squinting into distances. He held his flat cap in his hands, turning it by the brim.

“Mr. MacAulay.”

“Aye.”

“I’m Ewan Fraser. From over at Glenfincastle.” He nodded west, towards the high ground. “I manage the estate there. The shooting, the forestry.”

MacAulay knew the name. Glenfincastle was a vast, troubled tract of land—ancient Caledonian pine forest giving way to overgrazed moor, owned by an absentee syndicate based in Luxembourg. A textbook case of everything wrong with land ownership in Scotland. He had spoken about it once, in a speech on community right-to-buy. Empty rhetoric, then. A stone thrown into a pond, the ripples long since faded.

“I know it,” MacAulay said. He did not stand aside. “What can I do for you, Mr. Fraser?”

Fraser’s eyes, a pale, watery blue, looked past him into the dim interior of the cottage, then back to his face. They held no political recognition, only a blunt assessment. “It’s maybe more what I can do for you. Or what we might do for each other. May I come in? It’s not a conversation for a doorstep.”

The rhythm of the words was off. This was not a farmer come to complain about subsidies. There was a rehearsed quality beneath the rough tone. MacAulay felt the old antennae twitch, the ones that had sensed ambushes in committee rooms and traps in friendly briefings. He stepped back.

“I’ve no fresh tea made.”

“I didnae come for tea.”

Fraser stepped inside, his boots heavy on the flagstones. He did not look around at the books, the fireplace, the simple furniture. His gaze went straight to the table and fixed on the black feather. He stared at it for a long moment, then his eyes lifted to MacAulay’s.

“You found a token, then.”

The words hung in the air, specific and strange. *A token of nothing. A sign of everything.*

“It was on the step,” MacAulay said, his voice neutral. “A bird moulted. It’s of no consequence.”

“Is it not?” Fraser moved to the table but did not sit. He placed his cap beside the feather, a circle of brown tweed next to the sleek black. “They’re clever birds, ravens. They watch. They remember faces. They’re said to carry messages between worlds.”

“This one carried a message from a hedge, likely. I’m no’ a superstitious man, Mr. Fraser.”

“Nor me.” Fraser leaned forward, his knuckled hands resting on the table. “But I am a practical one. And I know a sign when one is left for me. Or for a man I’ve been asked to approach.”

The forge-heat of MacAulay’s new peace cooled, hardening into something alert and wary. “Approached by whom?”

“By people who read your statement. Who watched your… performance. Who know the weight of the stones you’ve been carrying.” Fraser’s voice dropped, not to a whisper, but to a low, confidential register meant for speaking in open spaces where sound could travel. “They think you might understand the weight of a different kind of stone. One that’s still in the wall, but shouldnae be.”

MacAulay sat down slowly, opposite the man. He did not pick up his tea. “You’re speaking in riddles. I’ve left that world. The walls, the stones—they’re metaphors in a memoir now. I’ve no interest in real ones.”

“Aye, you have. You just dinnae know it yet.” Fraser finally took a seat. He pulled a folded map from his jacket pocket, not a modern OS sheet, but an older, linen-backed thing, its creases deep and white. He spread it on the table, covering the feather. It was a detailed estate map of Glenfincastle. “You spoke once, in the Parliament, about this land. Called it a ‘scar on the conscience of the nation.’ Remember?”

“I said many things.”

“This one was heard. Not by the syndicate. Not by the government. By the people who live in its shadow. The ones the syndicate wants gone.” His blunt finger stabbed at a cluster of markings in a glen, tucked under the shoulder of a mountain. “There’s a hamlet here. A dozen homes, a workshop, a bit of shared grazing. A community. The lease is ancient. The syndicate’s lawyers have found a flaw in it. A clause about ‘active maintenance of traditional ways.’ They’re arguing the place is a museum, not a working settlement. They want it cleared. For ‘rewilding.’ A tidy, green excuse for a land grab.”

MacAulay looked at the map. He could see the tactical beauty of it from the syndicate’s view. Use the fashionable language of environmentalism to erase an inconvenient history, to clear the land for richer, less troublesome clients—deer-stalking billionaires, perhaps, or carbon-offset portfolios. It was a new corruption, dressed in green wool.

“It’s a legal matter,” MacAulay said, the old ministerial reflex. “The Land Court—”

“Is slow. And the syndicate is fast. They’ve already cut the access road. ‘Ecological restoration.’ No vehicle can get in or out except by quad bike. The post van has stopped. The school bus turns back. It’s death by a thousand cuts, and the law moves like a glacier. The people there will be worn down, bought out for pennies, or simply forced out before the first snow.”

“And what,” MacAulay asked, his eyes on the map, not on Fraser, “do you imagine I can do? I have no power. No influence I care to use. I am, as the papers said yesterday, a spent force.”

Fraser’s laugh was a short, dry bark. “Spent? You just set yourself on fire in front of the whole country. That’s not spent. That’s… volatile. Unpredictable. You’re a man with nothing left to lose, who just told a very compelling story about the poison of power. That makes you interesting. It makes you a potential lever.”

“A lever for whom?”

“For them.” Fraser tapped the hamlet on the map again. “And for the people I answer to. The ones who left the feather.”

MacAulay looked up then, meeting the man’s pale eyes. “Who are they?”

“A name would mean nothing to you. A collection of names. Some from the old land leagues. Some from the new ecology movements. Lawyers who work pro bono. Surveyors who turn a blind eye. People who believe land should be for the many, not the few, and who are tired of asking nicely.” He leaned back, folding his arms. “They call themselves *An Fhìrinn*. The Truth.”

“A dramatic name for a pressure group.”

“It’s not a pressure group. It’s a network. Sometimes, it provides legal aid. Sometimes, it… creates facts on the ground. It mends the flaws in leases. It finds lost title deeds. It ensures access roads are mysteriously cleared after a storm. It’s a quiet counter-weight. A different kind of masonry.”

MacAulay understood now. He was not being asked for his voice, or his signature. He was being assessed for his hands. For his willingness to lift stones in the dark.

“You’re talking about illegality.”

“I’m talking about justice where the law has been bent into a tool for injustice. The syndicate’s case is legal. It is not right. *An Fhìrinn* deals in what is right. Sometimes that requires a degree of… pragmatic interpretation of the rules.”

“And why would I, of all people, be of interest? The confessed sinner of Holyrood?”

“Because you understand the cost.” Fraser’s voice lost its rehearsed edge, becoming earnest, almost fervent. “You stood up and said the system was corrupt, that it wore a man down, that it asked him to compromise until the compromise was all that was left. This syndicate, these faceless funds—they’re the pure product of that system. They are the corruption, distilled into an asset class. You fought the symptom in yourself. Here’s a chance to strike at the disease in the world.”

The words were seductive. They fitted the lens of his own recent reckoning too neatly. It felt like a script, written for him. The redeemed politician, finding purity in direct, extra-parliamentary action. A clean stone in his hand again.

“It’s a pretty speech,” MacAulay said, his tone deliberately flat. “But I am not a weapon to be aimed. I am a man trying to learn how to be a man again, without the office. That process does not involve joining a clandestine cell of land reformers.”

Fraser did not look disappointed. He nodded, as if this was the expected response. He folded the map carefully, restoring it to its precise creases. “I didnae think you would say yes. Not today.” He stood, picking up his cap. “But they asked me to extend the invitation. To show you the first stone.” He placed a small, sealed envelope on the table beside his cap. “The details of the hamlet. The legal flaw. The human cost. Read it. Or don’t. The feather was the invitation. This is the brief.”

He moved to the door. With his hand on the latch, he turned. “You said you were no longer the mason. Maybe you’re not. But you’ve a keen eye for a poorly laid wall. And you know what happens when the foundation stone is rotten. The whole thing comes down, eventually. The question is, do you walk away and let it fall on the folk inside? Or do you help them shore it up, by any means necessary?”

He left, closing the door softly behind him.

MacAulay sat in the returning silence. The cottage felt different. The quiet was no longer empty, but charged, as if the air held the echo of Fraser’s proposition. He looked at the envelope. Plain white, no marking. A stone of paper.

He thought of the peace of the accounted-for. It had been the peace of the past tense. All his sins, his compromises, laid out and owned. This was the future tense. A new ledger, with the first line waiting to be written. To act would be to engage again, to take up a cause, to become a player. To refuse was to truly retreat, to make his peace a final, quiet thing.

He picked up the envelope. It was light. Heavier than a feather, but not by much.

He did not open it. He placed it on the mantelpiece, leaning it against a stone he’d taken from the dyke years ago—a smooth, grey whinstone. A paper plea against a fragment of the land itself.

He spent the day in physical labour, splitting logs from the old ash tree that had come down in the autumn. The repetitive, brutal action of the maul, the clean split of the grain, the building pile of fuel—it was a therapy of simple outcomes. His muscles burned, his breath plumed in the cold air, and for stretches of minutes, his mind was blessedly blank, occupied only with balance and force.

But in the pauses, wiping sweat from his brow, he would look up at the cottage, and his eyes would find the window behind which the envelope lay. *By any means necessary.* Fraser’s phrase echoed the unspoken corners of his own career. How many times had he justified a ruthless parliamentary manoeuvre, a brutal media strategy, with a similar phrase? *For the greater good. To get the right thing done.* The corruption of power was not just in the overt lies or the stolen money. It was in that internal permission slip, the one you wrote for yourself, that said the ends justify the means. *An Fhìrinn* had just offered him a new permission slip, with a nobler end.

Was that the shadow he would always carry? Not the specific sins, but the propensity for the calculus? The ability to look at a line, and decide to step over it?

At dusk, he went inside, lit the fire with his new logs, and finally took the envelope down. He opened it with a thumb.

The contents were meticulous. Photographs of the hamlet—smoke from chimneys, children playing by a burn, an old man carving wood in a doorway. A copy of the original lease, with the contentious clause highlighted. A legal opinion from a respected advocate, stating the syndicate’s case was strong, if morally repugnant. A list of the residents, their ages, their trades. And a single, typewritten line on a separate sheet:

*The access road is their lifeline. It is currently blocked by felled trees, ‘for habitat.’ The forestry contractor is in the syndicate’s pocket. The local council cites jurisdiction issues. The road will be permanently declassified in six weeks. After that, the hamlet dies.*

No request. No instruction. Just a fact.

MacAulay fed the papers to the fire, one by one. He watched the photographs curl and blacken, faces vanishing into flame. He watched the legal language become ash. The heat on his face was immediate and real.

When it was done, he sat back. The feather was still on the table. He took it, rolling the shaft between his fingers. A token of nothing. A sign of everything.

He thought not of power, but of weight. The weight of a stone you chose to lift. The weight of a door you chose to close. The negligible, certain lightness of a decision not made.

He slept fitfully. His dreams were of drystane dykes, but he was not building them. He was walking alongside them, and in every wall, he saw a single stone that was wrong—a rotten sandstone among granite, a weak, friable thing that threatened the integrity of the whole. And in his dream, his hands itched to pull it out, but he had no right. The walls were not his.

He woke in the dark, hours before dawn. The fire was embers. The cottage was cold. A clear, hard certainty had crystallised in him, not in his thinking mind, but in his blood and bone.

He dressed in old, dark clothes. He took a heavy-duty torch from the cupboard. He did not ask himself why. He was simply following the impulse, the way one might follow the course of a burn downhill.

He drove his old Land Rover, lights off until he was well away from the cottage, navigating by memory and the faint glow of a three-quarter moon. He knew the back road to Glenfincastle. It took an hour of slow, jolting progress over tracks sheep had made.

He parked in a forestry plantation a mile from the hamlet’s access road. He walked the rest, the torch off, his eyes adjusting to the moonlight. The night was vast and silent, the sky a deep, cold violet pricked with stars. His breath was steady. He felt no fear, only a profound, focused clarity. He was not Alistair MacAulay, former First Minister. He was a man walking through the night to look at a wall.

He found the blockage. It was not subtle. Three mature spruce trees had been felled across the narrow track, their trunks too thick for any vehicle to pass. The cuts were fresh, the sap still smelling sharp in the frozen air. It was not forestry. It was a barricade.

He stood for a long time, looking at it. The means were crude, but the message was elegant: *You are not welcome. You do not belong. This is not yours.*

He heard it, this message, in the voice of a hundred polite civil servants, a hundred glossy corporate brochures, a hundred legal opinions that privileged property over people. It was the same voice that had once asked him, in a panelled room in Whitehall, to consider the *practical realities* of independence. The voice of the immovable object.

He switched on his torch, playing the beam over the tangled mass of branches and trunk. It was a formidable obstacle. It would take machinery, or a dozen men with saws, to clear it.

He was one man. He had no saw.

He turned the beam to the side of the track, where the ditch was shallow, the bank a gentle slope. He walked its length, twenty yards up, twenty yards down. The ground was rough, studded with heather tussocks and stones, but it was passable. For a determined driver in a 4x4, it would be a bumpy, careful detour, but a possible one. The ditch itself was dry.

He switched off the torch and stood in the moonlight again. He was not here to clear the road. He was here to see. To understand the stone in the wall.

But as he turned to leave, his foot caught on something half-buried in the heather—a rusted iron stake, likely an old fence post. He bent and pulled it free. It was about three feet long, heavy, solid. One end was pointed.

He held it, feeling its cold, brutal heft. A tool. A lever. A weapon.

Without conscious thought, he walked back to the nearest felled tree, where its upper branches splayed across the ditch. He jammed the pointed end of the stake under a thick, springy limb, pressed down with his weight, and heaved.

The branch groaned, resisted, then with a loud, cracking sigh, it bent upwards, tearing free from where it was pinned under the trunk. He shoved again, and the entire mass of foliage shifted, rolling sideways, off the ditch and fully onto the track. He had not cleared the ditch. He had made it more blocked.

But now, the other side of the ditch—the gentle, passable slope—was utterly clear. A vehicle could pass there unimpeded. He had not removed the obstacle. He had moved it. He had altered the geometry of the problem.

He stood back, sweat cooling on his back despite the cold. He looked at what he had done. It was a small thing. A negligible act. It would be seen, tomorrow, as an accident of the tree’s fall, or the work of vandals. It was not a political statement. It was not an act of *An Fhìrinn*. It was just a man, in the night, using a found tool to change the lay of the land. A pragmatic interpretation of the rules.

He threw the iron stake deep into the forest. The sound of its landing was swallowed by the dark.

He walked back to his vehicle, the moon his only witness. He felt no exhilaration. No righteousness. Only a deep, humming tension in his nerves, and a new, unfamiliar taste in his mouth—metallic, like the stake, like blood, like a decision made in silence.

He drove home as the first grey light smudged the eastern hills. The cottage was as he had left it. The feather was on the table. The space on the mantelpiece was empty.

He made tea and sat by the window, watching the world emerge from monochrome into colour. The peace of the accounted-for was gone. In its place was something more vital, more dangerous: the quiet of the engaged. The quiet of a man who has, for reasons he may never fully articulate, chosen his side of the wall.

He had not joined anything. He had not given an answer. But he had acted. And the action, small and deniable as it was, had committed him. He knew it. The corruption of power was a shadow. But the allure of agency, of direct, tangible effect—that was a flame. And he had just struck a match.

The hook for his coat was by the door. As he hung up his jacket, something fell from the pocket and fluttered to the floor.

Not a feather.

A small, square card, plain, unmarked. On one side, in the same typeface as the papers he had burned, was a grid reference. And beneath it, a date and a time. Three nights from now.

He picked it up. He had not put it there. Fraser must have slipped it into his pocket during their conversation. An assumption. A next step.

MacAulay held the card. He felt the weight of it, no more than a gram of paper. It was not a request. It was a test. They had seen him look at the map. They had watched his cottage. They had, perhaps, followed him tonight. They were observing, remembering.

Like the raven.

He placed the card on the table next to the feather. Two tokens now. One of nature’s indifference. One of a network’s intent.

He looked out at the new day. The frost was thick on the grass, each blade sheathed in brittle, white light. It was a glittering, beautiful, treacherous surface. A man could walk on it, for a time. But beneath, the earth was waiting, soft and dark and real.

He had stepped off the path. He had felt the ground give, just a little, under his weight.

The question for Chapter 14 was no longer *if*. It was *how far*.



---

# Chapter 14

## **CHAPTER 14**

The card lay on the table for two days. It did not change. The grid reference did not blur. The date and the time, printed in that same, faintly archaic typeface, did not shift. They were a fact. MacAulay moved around it, making tea, reading reports on fisheries quotas and transport infrastructure, the minutiae of a devolved administration. He was a man orbiting a fixed, silent point. The feather he had placed in a small, wooden bowl. The card he left exposed. One was a relic. The other was a fuse.

On the morning of the third day, Sir Jeremy Cathcart arrived at the Edinburgh office. He brought with him the scent of chilled morning air and a folder of impeccable thickness.

“The Prime Minister’s office has confirmed the agenda for the bilateral,” Cathcart said, laying the folder on MacAulay’s desk with the solemnity of a priest placing a sacrament. “The tone is notably… collegiate.”

MacAulay did not open the folder. “Collegiate. Is that the word they used?”

“It is the subtext. The language is all ‘partnership’ and ‘shared challenges’. The rough edges from the last meeting appear to have been filed smooth.” Cathcart allowed himself a minute adjustment of his cuff. “One might almost believe they’ve listened.”

“One might. Or one might believe they’ve decided on a different type of knife.” MacAulay’s gaze drifted past Cathcart to the window, to the pale, hard sky over the Firth. “A blunt instrument makes a mess. A surgical blade doesn’t. The outcome is the same. It’s the aesthetics that differ.”

“A cynical reading, First Minister.”

“A historical one.” MacAulay finally looked at him. “Tell me, Jeremy. In your experience, when a government becomes unexpectedly reasonable, what is it usually covering for?”

Cathcart’s expression was a closed door. “I wouldn’t presume to speculate. My role is to ensure you are prepared for the meeting as it is presented. Not as it might be in the darker corners of your imagination.”

“My imagination doesn’t have corners. It’s a round room. No shadows.” MacAulay smiled, a thin, humourless stretch of skin. “It’s all just… light.”

The meeting passed in a river of detail. Cathcart was a master of the channel, guiding the flow around rocks, over shallows, never letting it spill into the wild, uncharted land of actual intent. MacAulay played his part. He asked precise questions. He noted concerns. He was the executive, engaged. All the while, in the round room of his mind, he saw the card. The grid reference was a place in the Cairngorms, east of the Lairig Ghru. A place of high, lonely moor and peat-dark lochans. A place where the wind carved sound from the air and left only silence behind.

He dismissed Cathcart in the late afternoon. The light was failing, leaching the colour from the city, turning the stone of the buildings to the grey of a worn coin. He sat in the gathering dark, no lamp lit. The corruption of power, he thought, was not a sudden fall. It was not a hand snatching a bag of gold. It was a series of small, rational accommodations. It was the acceptance of a narrower and narrower frame of action. It was being led, by degrees, into a room where every door was the same, and every one locked from the outside. The ultimate corruption was the belief that the room was the entire world.

What Fraser offered was a window. Not an exit. A view. And a man who had spent too long in a room of locked doors would, eventually, break the glass. Even if the air outside was thin enough to kill him.

He drove north out of the city as the last of the twilight bled into a clear, star-pricked night. He took no government car. He drove his own, an ageing Volvo estate with mud on its sills from forgotten trips to the coast. It was a vehicle that held no status, promised no importance. It was anonymous. He felt a peculiar lightness as the streetlights fell away and the darkness of the countryside swallowed him. For a few hours, he was not the First Minister. He was a man in a car, following a set of numbers to a blank point on a map. The simplicity was almost erotic.

He turned off the main road near Blair Atholl, onto a single-track lane that climbed and twisted into the hills. The tarmac gave way to gravel, then to a rutted track of compacted earth and stone. The headlights carved a tunnel through the absolute black, picking out the startled eyes of a sheep, the gnarled fist of a wind-blasted hawthorn. The air coming through the vent grew cold and sharp with the scent of peat and frost.

The track ended at a small, rough parking area by a forestry gate. One other vehicle was there: a battered Land Rover Defender, its green paint matte and scratched. It looked like a piece of the landscape that had temporarily assembled itself into a car. MacAulay parked beside it, killed the engine. The silence was immense, a physical pressure on the ears. He got out. The cold seized him, clean and shocking. The sky was a vast, black dome dusted with diamond-shards. He could see the Milky Way, a faint, luminous scar across the heavens.

A figure detached itself from the shadow of the Defender. Not Fraser. A woman. She was tall, wrapped in a dark, waxed jacket, her face pale in the starlight.

“First Minister.” Her voice was low, carrying no further than the space between them. It held a Highland lilt, but flattened, educated elsewhere. “Follow me. And watch your step. The ground is uneven.”

She turned and began to walk, not towards the forestry gate, but along a deer path that skirted the plantation. MacAulay fell in behind her. They walked in silence for twenty minutes, climbing steadily. The only sounds were the crunch of their boots on frozen heather, the sigh of the wind over the high passes. His breath plumed in the air. The exertion warmed his blood. He felt acutely alive, every sense heightened. This was not the curated, climate-controlled world of Whitehall. This was the old, indifferent bone-structure of the land.

They crested a rise and below them, in a shallow bowl carved by glaciers, lay a small, dark lochan. Its surface was a perfect, black mirror, reflecting the stars. On the near shore, a low, stone bothy stood, its roof sagging, a faint orange glow seeping from around a shuttered window.

The woman led him down to the door. She knocked once, a specific rhythm: two taps, a pause, three taps. The door opened inward.

The heat hit him first, a solid wall of it from a cast-iron stove glowing cherry-red in the corner. The room was small, smoky, lit by two gas lanterns hissing on a rough table. Books and maps were piled on a shelf. A kettle steamed on the stove. Three people looked up as he entered.

Fraser was one, sitting on a stool, whittling a piece of wood with a small knife. He nodded, as if MacAulay were a neighbour who had popped in. The second was a man in his sixties, with a fierce, intelligent face and a head of thick, white hair. He wore a fisherman’s sweater, darned at the elbows. The third was younger, late thirties, with the watchful, still posture of a soldier. He was studying a topographic map, a pencil in his hand.

“Alistair,” Fraser said. “You found us.”

“The directions were adequate.” MacAulay unzipped his coat, the transition from the Arctic outside to the tropics within already making him sweat.

The white-haired man stood. He moved with an academic’s careful grace. “First Minister. I am Professor Ewan Ross. Formerly of the Department of War Studies, King’s College London. Currently of nowhere, officially.” He did not offer his hand. “This is Calum.” The younger man glanced up, gave a curt nod, returned to his map.

“A professor, a soldier, and a gamekeeper,” MacAulay said, looking at Fraser. “It sounds like the start of a bad joke.”

“The punchline,” Ross said, his voice dry as old paper, “is usually a revolution. Or a hanging. Seldom anything in between.” He gestured to a vacant stool. “Sit. You’ll have questions. We may have answers.”

MacAulay sat. The woman who had led him here took up a position by the door, her back against the wall, listening to the night outside. He was surrounded. The thought was clear, but it carried no alarm. He had walked into this circle. The power, for the moment, was in the walking.

“You are The Blank Page,” MacAulay stated.

Ross smiled, a network of fine lines spreading from his eyes. “A dramatic name. Fraser’s, I think. I would have chosen something more scholarly. ‘The Disenchanted’. Or ‘The Realists’.”

“What do you want?”

“A simple question. The answer is less so.” Ross poured hot water from the kettle into a tin mug, added a tea bag, pushed it towards MacAulay. “We want the restoration of agency. Not to a government, or a parliament. To the people who constitute a nation. The mechanism of the modern state, particularly the British state, is designed to convert agency into administration. To turn the fierce, unpredictable will of a people into the manageable, predictable stream of policy and process. Devolution was meant to be a valve on that stream. It has become a longer pipe.”

Fraser set down his whittling. “They give you a watering can, Alistair. And tell you you’re in charge of the garden. But they control the reservoir. And they can turn it off whenever they like. Or poison the well.”

“And you?” MacAulay asked. “You have a different well?”

“We have a map of the watershed,” Ross said. “We know where the water comes from. And we know the points of pressure. The weak spots in the pipe.”

Calum spoke without looking up from his map. His voice was quiet, but it cut through the hiss of the lanterns. “Power isn’t about having the biggest army. It’s about control of systems. Logistics. Information. Energy. Data. The British state is a master of systemic control. But all systems have redundancies. And all redundancies have a breaking point.”

MacAulay sipped the tea. It was strong, bitter. “You’re talking about sabotage. Terrorism.”

Ross shook his head, a teacher correcting a promising but misguided student. “We are talking about *leverage*. Terrorism is the act of a desperate outsider, smashing the window to be heard. Leverage is the act of a knowledgeable insider, turning off the lights in one room to illuminate the truth in another. We are not outsiders, First Minister. We are the people who built the rooms. Who wired the lights. Fraser here knows every landholding, every hereditary right, every buried covenant that can stall a Westminster infrastructure project for a decade. I know the intellectual architecture of every security and intelligence doctrine of the last fifty years. I know their assumptions, and therefore their blind spots. Calum knows how the physical architecture actually works. The data cables that run under the old railway lines. The backup power grids for the GCHQ relay station on the Isle of Lewis. The emergency protocols for the Faslane base that are, amusingly, routed through a server in Slough.”

A log shifted in the stove, sending up a shower of sparks. MacAulay felt the weight of what was being offered. It was not a weapon. It was a blueprint. A schematic of the edifice of power, with certain load-bearing walls highlighted in red.

“This is treason,” MacAulay said, the word hanging in the smoky air.

“It is a realignment of priority,” Ross replied. “Is it treason for a doctor to ignore a hospital’s bureaucracy to save a patient? The British state is not Britain. It is a system that governs it. Sometimes, to save the patient, you must bypass the system. Temporarily. Strategically.”

“To what end? You collapse a few systems, cause some chaos. Then what? You don’t have an army. You don’t have a political mandate.”

“We have you,” Fraser said simply.

The silence that followed was absolute. The wind outside had dropped. The only sound was the faint hiss of the gas.

“You are the legitimacy,” Ross continued, his eyes fixed on MacAulay. “The elected First Minister. In the event of a catastrophic, systemic failure of the apparatus of government—a failure not of your making—you would have the constitutional responsibility, and the moral authority, to assume emergency powers to ensure stability, continuity, and the safety of the people. To restore order on new terms. The terms of the actual social contract, not the administrative one.”

MacAulay laughed, a short, sharp bark that held no humour. “You are insane. You are describing a coup.”

“We are describing a *catalyst*,” Ross insisted, leaning forward. The lamplight deepened the hollows of his face. “The British state is undergoing a slow-motion collapse of legitimacy. It is hollowed out by corruption, by nostalgia, by a profound disconnect between its governing class and the governed. It will fall. The only question is what follows. Will it be a chaotic, violent rupture, exploited by the worst elements? Or can it be a managed, deliberate transition? A return of sovereignty not to a flag, but to the ground under our feet? We are offering you the tools to guide that transition. To be the author of what comes next, not its victim.”

MacAulay stood up. The stool scraped on the stone floor. He walked to the small, grimy window, looked out at the black lochan, the star-strung sky. The peace of the accounted-for was gone, shattered. In its place was this: a conspiracy in a bothy, offering him the keys to a kingdom of chaos. The allure of agency was no longer a flame. It was a wildfire, and they were asking him to hold the torch.

“Why me?” he asked the glass.

“Because you are a pragmatist, not an ideologue,” Ross said from behind him. “Because you understand power, and you are already sickened by its current flavour. Because you stood at that wall, Alistair. You looked at the map. You took the papers. You came here tonight. You are already walking on the frost. We are merely suggesting a direction.”

MacAulay turned. “And if I say no? If I walk out of here and call the Security Service?”

Calum looked up from his map for the first time. His eyes were a flat, calm grey. “Then you walk out. The card is paper. This conversation never happened. We are ghosts. But the frost will still be there. And one night, you will be standing on it when it cracks. And you will fall, with the rest of them, into the dark. We are offering you a rope.”

“Manufactured by you.”

“The only rope there is,” Fraser said.

MacAulay looked at each of them: the professor, the soldier, the keeper, the silent woman by the door. They were not fanatics. Their eyes were clear, calculating. They were engineers of consequence. He thought of the Prime Minister’s ‘collegiate’ tone. The smooth, smiling knife. He thought of the room of locked doors. He thought of the weight of the stone in his hand. *Throw it, or don’t.*

He did not have a stone. He had a card with a grid reference.

“I am not saying yes,” MacAulay said, his voice low. “I am saying I will listen.”

Ross nodded, as if this was the only answer he had expected. “Then listen to this. The devolution review. The ‘collegiate’ bilateral. It is a facade. The Prime Minister’s strategy is no longer to block or bully. It is to absorb. To integrate the Scottish government’s functions so seamlessly into a new ‘UK-wide framework’ for energy, trade, and security that devolution becomes a technical, not a political, reality. A spoke in the wheel, not a separate engine. They will offer you more money, more ‘co-operation’. In return, you will quietly surrender the very levers that make your government meaningful. It will be death by embrace. Within eighteen months, your office will be a glorified county council. A tourist attraction.”

“How do you know this?”

“Because I wrote the first draft of the strategy paper,” Ross said. “Five years ago. It was considered too subtle then. Now, with the current political fractures, it is seen as elegant. Inevitable. The final document is on the Permanent Secretary’s desk. Sir Jeremy Cathcart has had it for a week.”

The words landed in MacAulay’s gut like a stone. *Cathcart.* The polished neutrality. The well-cut overcoat of a knighthood. He saw the man arranging invisible lint, guiding the river of detail. A man who knew the destination of every stream.

“You’re certain.”

“The document reference is CAB/114/77. It is in a blue folder, not the red one he will show you. He is waiting for the right psychological moment to present it—likely after a good dinner, when you are feeling the warmth of their collegiality. He will frame it as an opportunity. A historic integration.”

MacAulay believed him. The specificity was a bullet. It had the cold, certain heft of truth.

“What is your proposal?” The question left his lips before he could call it back. He was no longer orbiting the point. He was falling towards it.

Calum tapped his pencil on the map. “A demonstration. A small one. To prove our capability, and to show you the nature of the leverage. A targeted, non-violent intervention. It will cause a significant, temporary inconvenience to a key Westminster project. It will be untraceable. And it will carry a signature that only you will understand.”

“What signature?”

“The blank page,” Fraser said. “A void where their power is supposed to be.”

“And if I refuse?”

“Then the demonstration does not happen. We remain ghosts. And you go to your meeting with Cathcart and the Prime Minister, and you accept the blue folder, and you begin the process of presiding over your own political euthanasia.”

MacAulay walked back to the stool. He sat down heavily. The heat from the stove was oppressive now, cloying. He felt the sweat trickle down his spine. This was the moment. The *how far*. He could stand up, walk out into the clean, cold dark, and drive back to the world of folders and agendas and slow, respectable surrender. Or he could take a step onto the glittering, treacherous surface they were mapping for him.

He thought of the raven. Watching. Remembering.

“A demonstration,” he repeated. “Non-violent. Contained.”

“Contained,” Ross confirmed.

“And I give no order. I simply… do not object.”

“Your silence is the permission. Your continued presence here is the acquiescence.”

MacAulay looked at the mug of tea, now cold. He saw his own distorted reflection in the dark surface. He did not recognise the man looking back.

“When?” he asked.

Calum looked at his watch. “In approximately forty-seven hours.”

So soon. It was real. It was moving. He had not thrown the stone. But he had nodded to the man who would throw it for him. The corruption was not in the act. It was in the space between the question and the answer. It was in the quiet of the engaged.

He stood again. “I need to go.”

No one moved to stop him. The woman by the door straightened, ready to lead him back. Fraser gave him a last, slow nod. Ross’s eyes held a strange, paternal pity.

“The frost is beautiful, Alistair,” the old professor said softly. “But it is not the land. Remember which one you serve.”

MacAulay walked out into the night. The cold was a physical blow, washing away the stifling heat of the bothy, but not the fever in his mind. The walk back to the car was a dream. The stars were pitiless. The woman left him at the edge of the parking area, melting back into the shadows without a word.

He drove for an hour before he pulled over on a deserted stretch of road, shaking so violently he had to grip the steering wheel to still himself. He opened the car door and vomited onto the gravel verge, the bitter tea and the acid taste of conspiracy. He spat, wiped his mouth, stared up at the indifferent stars.

He had not joined anything. He had not given an answer.

But he had listened. And in that room, listening was the contract.

When he finally arrived back at the cottage, the sky to the east was showing the first faint smear of grey. He was exhausted, hollowed out. He went to the table. The card was still there. He picked it up. It was just paper. It had no power. He had given it all.

He placed it back on the table. He did not burn it.

He went to the window. The dawn was coming, a slow seep of light into the world. The frost was thick on his own grass, glittering, beautiful, treacherous. He had felt the ground give. Now he had agreed to test its strength.

In his pocket, his encrypted government phone vibrated. He pulled it out. A message from Sir Jeremy Cathcart.

*First Minister. A thought occurred overnight. The PM’s office has hinted at a significant new proposal on shared energy infrastructure. I’ve taken the liberty of drafting some preliminary thoughts. I’ll bring the relevant folder to you at 10 a.m. It’s a blue one. I think you’ll find it most illuminating.*

MacAulay stared at the screen. The words were innocuous. Professional. The blue folder. CAB/114/77. The death by embrace.

He did not reply. He watched the message until the screen went dark, reflecting his own face back at him—a pale, haunted oval in the pre-dawn gloom.

The hook for the next chapter was not a question. It was a countdown. Forty-seven hours. And a blue folder on his desk at ten.



---

# Chapter 15

## **CHAPTER 15**

The blue folder sat on the desk in the private office at St Andrew’s House. It was a cold, institutional blue, the colour of a deep winter loch under a clouded sky. MacAulay did not touch it. He stood at the window, looking down over Edinburgh’s New Town, the Georgian geometry of it laid out like a promise of order. The frost of the morning had not lifted; it clung to the rooftops and the bare branches of the trees in the gardens, a gilded lie that would melt into grey slurry by noon.

He had slept for two hours, a thin and troubled sleep haunted by the image of the woman’s hands—practical, unadorned—placing a cup of bitter tea on a scarred table. The memory had the texture of a stone in his palm. He flexed his hand now, feeling the ghost of that weight.

A soft knock. The door opened before he could answer. Sir Jeremy Cathcart entered, a second, thinner file tucked under his arm. He closed the door with a precise, soundless click.

“First Minister. I trust the journey in was uneventful.”

“The roads were quiet,” MacAulay said, not turning. “Frost makes people careful. Or it sends them into ditches. There’s no middle ground.”

“A pertinent metaphor,” Cathcart said. MacAulay heard the faint rustle of the man settling into a chair, the whisper of wool on leather. “The folder, as promised.”

MacAulay turned. Cathcart was not looking at the blue folder. He was looking at MacAulay, his expression one of polite, focused interest, like a doctor observing symptoms.

“Illuminating, you said.”

“I believe so. It concerns the proposed North Sea Grid Interconnector. A joint UK-Scotland-Norway venture. On the surface, a textbook piece of strategic cooperation. Renewable energy sharing, market stability, security of supply. The Prime Minister is… keen. Exceptionally so.”

MacAulay walked to the desk. He rested his fingertips on the cool cardboard of the folder. “And below the surface?”

Cathcart steepled his fingers. “The financing model is Byzantine. A series of shell companies, layered debt, guarantees. The initial capital is to be raised through a Crown Entity bond, issued discreetly. The ultimate liability, however, flows one way. To the Scottish Government’s balance sheet. It is a masterclass in off-book obligation. If it were to fail—and the initial projections are, in my view, criminally optimistic—the political and financial cost would be… existential. For this administration.”

MacAulay opened the folder. The first page was a summary, dense with figures and legal citations. He did not read them. He looked at the header: *Project Trident*. The name was a blunt instrument.

“Why show me this? This is the ‘embrace’. You warned me of it.”

“I warned you of a pattern. This is the specific mechanism. Knowledge is not complicity, First Minister. It is forewarning.” Cathcart’s voice was a dry, administrative monotone. “The Prime Minister will present it as a gift. A significant new power, a shared venture. He will ask for your enthusiastic, public support. He will imply that hesitation would be a betrayal of the national interest—both Britains, if you will.”

“And if I refuse?”

“Then the proposal will be shelved. With regret. And the narrative will become one of missed opportunity, of parochialism. The devolution review negotiations, which begin in forty-six hours, would proceed under that cloud. Your leverage diminishes.” Cathcart paused. “If you accept, you bind your government to a financial sword of Damocles. One whose cord he holds.”

MacAulay turned a page. A map, showing thick lines snaking across the seabed from Aberdeen to Bergen, with a spider’s web of connections back to England. A hydra. “And you, Jeremy? Where do you stand in this?”

“I am a civil servant. I stand where I am placed. My duty is to ensure you are apprised of the facts as they are, not as one might wish them to be.” He adjusted the cuff of his shirt. “My… allegiance is to the integrity of the administration. This proposal threatens that integrity. Therefore, I bring it to you.”

It was the closest the man had ever come to declaring a side. MacAulay heard the unspoken text, the sub-clause: *for now*.

“What’s in the other file?”

Cathcart glanced at the slim folder on his knee. “A contingency. Should you wish to… test the ground, as it were. A discreet inquiry into the ultimate beneficial ownership of the primary shell company. It is a tortuous path. It leads, I suspect, to a private equity consortium with very close ties to the Prime Minister’s party treasurer. And to several members of the House of Lords who sit on the Defence Select Committee.”

“Blackmail.”

“Due diligence,” Cathcart corrected softly. “A tool. Like any tool, its morality is defined by its application. The inquiry is, of course, deniable. And slow. It would not be completed before your meeting with the Prime Minister.”

“So it’s useless.”

“It is a seed. One plants seeds with a future harvest in mind, not tomorrow’s breakfast.” Cathcart stood, leaving the thin folder on the chair. “I shall leave you to consider the illumination. The PM’s private office will call at three to confirm the pre-meeting chat tomorrow. I advise a non-committal welcome. Enthusiasm can be calibrated later.”

He left with the same silent precision. MacAulay was alone with the two folders. One blue and thick, a weapon aimed at his government’s heart. One grey and thin, a potential weapon of his own, slow-growing and poisonous.

He sat. He read the blue folder in its entirety. The complexity was the point. It was designed to be daunting, to make surrender to the summary seem rational. The numbers were beautiful, logical, and entirely fictional. They promised a world of green energy and shared prosperity. They mandated a death by a thousand contractual cuts.

His encrypted phone buzzed. Not the government one. The other. The one from the card.

A single line. *A friend suggests you walk in the Royal Botanic Garden this afternoon. The Alpine House. 3 p.m. The air is clear there.*

He deleted the message. He looked from the blue folder to the grey one. Two levers. Two forms of corruption. One was offered by the state, polished and legal. The other was offered from the shadows, raw and deniable. To resist the first, he would have to grasp the second. The ground was not just giving way; it was demanding he choose which crevice to fall into.

He closed the blue folder. He placed the thin grey folder inside his desk drawer. He locked it.

Then he put on his coat and left, telling his aide he was going for an airing. The frost had melted, as he knew it would. The streets were left damp and sullied.

*

The Royal Botanic Garden was a world of sleeping potential. The trees were skeletal, the borders bare. Winter had pared everything back to its essence. MacAulay walked without hurry, his hands deep in his coat pockets. He saw no one watching him, which meant they were good. Or he was wrong, and this was merely a walk.

The Alpine House was a glass dome, a bubble of controlled climate. He pushed through the heavy door, and the warm, dry air of a mountain summer enveloped him. It was a shock, like stepping into a memory. The air *was* clear—thin, sharp, scented with dust and stone and tiny, tenacious blooms. He was alone among the miniature landscapes, the careful arrangements of rock and hardy, low-growing plants that survived at the edge of the world.

He did not have to wait long.

“They favour extremes, these plants.” The voice came from behind a tall rockery display. It was a man’s voice, educated, with a faint, unplaceable accent. “What would kill others is their necessity. The poor soil. The searing sun. The brutal cold.”

A man stepped into view. He was in his late fifties, dressed in a nondescript waxed jacket and corduroy trousers. He had the lean, weathered face of a hillwalker, but his eyes were the colour of flint, and they missed nothing. He held a small, open notebook, as if studying the specimens.

“I’m told you’re a friend,” MacAulay said, not moving.

“I am a friend to a cause. That may, at times, align with friendship to a person.” The man closed his notebook. “You were visited last night. You listened. That is a beginning.”

“It was a monologue. I was given no terms, no structure.”

“Structure implies an institution. We are not that. We are a… confluence. Of interests. Of grievances. Of capabilities.” The man gestured to a small, star-shaped yellow flower clinging to a crevice. “*Saxifraga oppositifolia*. Purple saxifrage. It blooms on the summit of Ben Nevis. It cracks rock to root. A gentle, persistent force.”

“I’m not interested in botany.”

“But you are. You are surrounded by delicate, hothouse flowers. The Westminster system. The Whitehall mandarinate. They require rich feed, constant, temperate care. They cannot survive where this can.” The man’s flint eyes fixed on MacAulay. “You have been shown the embrace. The blue folder.”

MacAulay’s blood went still. He showed nothing. “What of it?”

“It is the perfected form of their power. Economic, legal, polite. It strangles without a mark. To refuse it requires a strength they do not understand. A strength that can grow in poor soil.” The man took a step closer, his voice dropping, blending with the gentle hum of the climate system. “We can provide the leverage you need to refuse it.”

“The grey folder.”

A slight, acknowledging tilt of the head. “A seed. We planted it. We can make it grow. Faster than Sir Jeremy believes possible. The connections, the financial flows, the names. We have them. Not suspicions. Proof. Drip-fed into the right channels—a financial journalist here, a select committee clerk there—it would create a stink around Project Trident that would make it untouchable. The PM would have to drop it or be splattered.”

“And the cost?”

“Your public, principled opposition to the project. A fiery speech in the Chamber. A leak of your ‘deep concerns’ to the press. You become the man who said no to Westminster’s poisoned chalice. Your popularity soars. Your leverage for the devolution review increases exponentially.”

“And I become your figurehead.”

“You become your own man. Using tools we provide. The alternative is to take the folder, sign the agreement, and slowly bleed your country into a vassal state of debt and dependency. A managerial death.” The man’s smile was thin, without warmth. “You are a man who understands the weight of a stone, First Minister. Some stones are for building walls. Some are for breaking windows. You must now decide which kind of mason you are.”

MacAulay looked at the saxifrage, its improbable bloom in this fabricated alpine air. It was a trick. A beautiful, resilient trick. “You want a rupture.”

“We want a shift. Ruptures are messy. But sometimes, a crack is necessary for new growth. Your meeting tomorrow with the Prime Minister. Go. Listen. Gauge the depth of the embrace. Then decide. If you wish to act, leave your government phone in your car when you next visit your constituency office. The signal will be taken as assent. The first leak will appear within twelve hours.”

The man gave a curt nod, turned, and walked away down the gravel path, stopping to apparently examine another plant. He did not look back.

MacAulay stood in the artificial warmth. He felt the two folders, one on his desk, one in his drawer, as physical weights inside him. He felt the stone from the dyke in his hand. The clean decision.

There was no clean decision. There was only the choice of corruption: the slow, legal, suffocating kind, or the sharp, hidden, explosive kind. One would kill his ambitions with kindness. The other might kill his soul with necessity.

He left the Alpine House. The outside air was a slap of cold, wet reality. He walked back through the dormant garden, the sleeping earth, towards the city and the desk that awaited him.

*

The call from the Prime Minister’s office came at three-fifteen. Sir Jeremy took it in MacAulay’s presence, on speakerphone. The Principal Private Secretary’s voice was creamy with collegiality.

“First Minister, good afternoon. The PM is so looking forward to your chat tomorrow. He’s cleared the deck for a proper, wide-ranging discussion. The future of the Union, all that. He’s asked me to mention he’s had the kitchen prepare some of that excellent shortbread you liked last time.”

“How thoughtful of him,” MacAulay said, his voice flat.

“He is a thoughtful man. He also wondered if you’d had a moment to glance at the energy proposal his team sent over? The North Sea Grid? He’s terribly excited about it.”

“I’ve seen the outline,” MacAulay said.

“Splendid. He’ll be eager to hear your initial thoughts. Eleven o’clock then? In the Cabinet Room?”

“I’ll be there.”

The call ended. Cathcart exhaled slowly. “The shortbread is a threat. He only breaks it out when he expects compliance.”

“I know.”

“Your tone was… correct. Non-committal. The folder?”

“Is a masterpiece of malign ingenuity.”

“And your inclination?”

MacAulay looked at the grey sky through the window. “My inclination is to throw the whole damn thing in the Thames.”

“A cathartic impulse, but not a policy.” Cathcart gathered his papers. “I will draft two sets of talking points for you. One, a framework for cautious engagement with the project. Two, a list of technical concerns that could justify delay. The latter will be feeble. The structure is designed to override them.”

“Do it.”

When Cathcart was gone, MacAulay unlocked his drawer. He took out the thin grey folder. He opened it. It contained a single sheet of paper with a list of company names, arrows drawn between them in black ink. At the centre, circled, was a name: *Vulcan Holdings*. And a handwritten note, not in Cathcart’s script: *Ask about the fire in the Gibraltar data vault. 2019.*

He closed the folder. He had a name. He had a direction. It was a stone. He could feel its heft.

*

The evening found him in his Edinburgh flat, not the cottage. The city lights glittered, cold and distant. He poured a whisky, not to taste it, but to feel the burn. He thought of the woman in the safe house, her calm, absolute certainty. He thought of the man in the garden, his flint eyes and his talk of cracks and growth. He thought of Sir Jeremy Cathcart, a man navigating by a star only he could see.

He thought of the Prime Minister, with his shortbread and his smile and his legal, lethal embrace.

His government phone buzzed. A reminder for tomorrow. *Meeting: PM. Cabinet Room. 11 a.m.*

His other phone, the secret one, was silent. A blank slate. A choice unmade.

He finished the whisky. The decision was not about morality. It was about anatomy. What could you live without? A limb? A principle? A clean conscience?

He went to the small balcony. The night was clear now, the stars visible between the rushing clouds. Pitiless, as they had been over the safe house. He had agreed to test the ground. Now the test was here. It was not a question of whether the ground would hold, but which piece of it he would choose to stand on as it gave way.

The hook for the next chapter was not a countdown. It was a man, standing in the Cabinet Room, smelling shortbread and ambition, with a stone in each pocket, waiting to see which one he would throw.

# Chapter 16

## **CHAPTER 16**

The Cabinet Room smelled of beeswax, old paper, and a faint, cloying note of vanilla. Shortbread. It sat on a silver tray beside the Prime Minister’s elbow, a prop of homely artifice. Alistair MacAulay stood just inside the door, letting the atmosphere settle on him like dust. He had arrived early, a calculated move. To be found in place was a form of possession.

The room was a theatre of subdued power. The long coffin of polished mahogany, the red leather chairs, the portraits of men who had won wars and lost empires staring blankly down. The light was London light, filtered through tall windows and centuries of precedent, falling in pale slabs on the empty chair at the table’s head. MacAulay’s own chair, halfway down on the left, seemed a continent away from it. He did not sit. He moved to the window, looking down into the garden. The drizzle had gone. The sky was a hard, high grey, the colour of a gun barrel.

He felt the two stones in his pockets. Not literal stones. The heft of them was psychic, a balanced pressure against each thigh. In his right pocket, the list from Cathcart: the engagement strategy, the technical obfuscations, the path of sanctioned delay. A legal, bureaucratic stone, smoothed by procedure. In his left, the weight of the grey folder and its single, incendiary page. *Vulcan Holdings. The fire in the Gibraltar data vault.* A jagged thing, all edges and fracture lines.

The door opened. He did not turn.

“First Minister. Admiring the view?” The Prime Minister’s voice was a warm, confident instrument. It filled spaces without seeming to try.

“Admiring the lack of it, Prime Minister,” MacAulay said, turning. “From my office in Edinburgh, I can see the Castle. It reminds me why I’m there. This…” He gestured to the manicured lawn, the empty benches. “This reminds me why I’m here.”

The Prime Minister, Charles Haddon, was a man who wore ease like a second skin. He was in shirtsleeves, his tie slightly loosened, an avatar of busy, approachable authority. He carried two files, which he placed on the table with a soft thump. “A necessary chore, I’m afraid. The price of union.” He smiled, indicating the shortbread. “I had them bring that in for you. A taste of home.”

“Very thoughtful.” MacAulay did not move towards it. The vanilla scent was stronger now, almost medicinal.

Haddon took his seat at the head of the table, not the Prime Minister’s usual chair, but one adjacent, a subtle gesture towards informality. He gestured for MacAulay to take the seat opposite. It was not MacAulay’s assigned chair. It was closer. The geometry of the room shifted, became intimate, a tête-à-tête masquerading as a state meeting.

MacAulay sat. The leather sighed beneath him, cold through the wool of his trousers.

“Alistair,” Haddon began, leaning forward, elbows on the table. The use of the Christian name was a velvet glove. “This devolution review. It’s a circus. You know it, I know it. A parade of grievances for the cameras. But the substance…” He tapped one of the files. “The substance is the North Sea Grid. Your pet project. Our shared opportunity.”

“It’s a piece of critical national infrastructure,” MacAulay corrected, his tone mild. “Not a pet.”

“Of course. Poor phrasing.” Haddon’s smile was unruffled. “The point is, its success is paramount. For Scotland’s energy future, for the UK’s security. The review’s terms of reference could… complicate the approval process. Introduce regional assemblies, new planning layers. Delay upon delay.” He spread his hands. “I want to cut through that. I want to offer you a fast-track. Whitehall-led, Treasury-backed, planning hurdles pre-cleared. Get the spades in the ground within eighteen months.”

The offer hung in the beeswax air, generous and immense. It was everything his government had lobbied for. It was Cathcart’s first stone, polished and offered back to him on a silver tray. MacAulay felt the weight in his right pocket grow denser, more legitimate.

“That’s a significant intervention,” MacAulay said. “What’s the price of the fast-track?”

Haddon’s eyes, a pleasant, forgettable blue, held his. “Coordination. Not a price, a partnership. The grid will be a UK asset. Its governance should reflect that. A joint oversight board. Westminster and Holyrood, yes, but with a casting vote residing here, on operational security matters.” He paused, letting the shape of the thing settle. “It’s a formality, really. A technicality. But it ensures nothing can be… weaponised. By either side.”

*Weaponised.* The word was carefully chosen. It spoke of suspicion, of a future where cooperation curdled. It made the casting vote sound like a sensible safeguard, not a veto.

“You’re asking me to cede sovereignty over a network built on Scottish wind, Scottish seabed,” MacAulay said, no inflection in his voice.

“I’m asking you to protect it,” Haddon countered smoothly. “From political winds. From your own hardliners who’d see it fail if they couldn’t wholly own it. This way, it gets built. Scotland gets the jobs, the energy, the investment. The glory is shared, but the prize is secured.” He leaned back. “It’s the adult solution, Alistair.”

The adult solution. MacAulay looked past Haddon, at the portrait of Pitt the Younger, a man who had spent his life holding a fracturing kingdom together. The face was pale, strained. There was no adult solution, only choices between kinds of failure.

“And the review?” MacAulay asked.

“The terms will be drafted… generously. A focus on cultural and educational devolution. The meaty economic levers, the union-critical ones, will be left for another day. A quieter day.” Haddon’s meaning was clear. *Kick the can. Take the win.*

MacAulay’s hand brushed his right pocket. The path was clear. He could agree in principle today. The details would be worked out by Cathcart and his counterparts. He would return to Edinburgh a victor, the man who delivered the grid. The price would be buried in annexes, a slow leak of authority that would only matter in a crisis. A crisis he might never see.

He thought of the woman in the safe house. *They create a weakness, then they offer to be your crutch.* He thought of the man in the garden. *The crack is where the light gets in. And the infection.*

“It’s a compelling offer, Prime Minister,” MacAulay said, his voice a dry, considered thing. “But I’ve been reviewing the consortium behind the main construction contract. Vulcan Holdings. Their structure is… opaque.”

A flicker, so swift it might have been a trick of the grey light, passed behind Haddon’s eyes. It was not surprise. It was recognition, quickly veiled. “Vulcan are solid. Financially robust. They’ve done major projects in the Gulf, in Asia. A UK-led consortium needs that global heft.”

“Heft is one thing,” MacAulay said, drawing the words out. “Transparency is another. There was an incident. A data vault fire. In Gibraltar. 2019. Wiped a significant number of their subsidiary records. Convenient timing, given the regulatory inquiries into offshore contracting in the region.”

The room was very quiet. The distant hum of Whitehall traffic was a world away. Haddon’s face had not changed, but the ease had solidified into something else, something like porcelain.

“Where did you hear about a vault fire?”

“The wind blows all sorts of debris into a First Minister’s office,” MacAulay said. “I make it a point to look at the debris. This particular piece… it suggests Vulcan’s robustness might be built on a foundation of conveniently missing paperwork. I’d be negligent to fast-track a project of this scale with that cloud hanging over the lead partner. Unless, of course, there’s a reassurance I’m missing.”

It was a throw. Not the full, jagged stone, but a chip of it. A test of the ground.

Haddon studied him for a long moment. The friendly pretence evaporated, not with anger, but with a slow, chilling precision. He reached for the shortbread, broke a piece off, but did not eat it. He crumbled it between his fingers on the polished wood.

“Alistair,” he said, and the name now was a tool, not a gift. “Governance is about seeing the big picture. Not every piece of debris is relevant. Sometimes, debris is just… mess. And in pursuit of a great national project, sometimes we have to tolerate a degree of mess. The alternative is paralysis. And paralysis is a luxury a united kingdom cannot afford.”

“Is that a reassurance?”

“It is the only reassurance you will get.” The words were flat, final. “Vulcan is the partner. The oversight board is the condition. The fast-track is the prize. This is the package. It is not a buffet from which you may pick and choose.”

The velvet glove was off. The architecture of the offer was laid bare: it was a single edifice. You took it whole, with its hidden rooms and its locked doors, or you did not take it at all.

MacAulay felt the two stones, left and right. The smooth one had just revealed its true nature: it was part of the same geology as the jagged one. The fast-track, the oversight, Vulcan Holdings—they were all facets of the same control. Accepting one meant accepting it all. The corruption was not a flaw in the offer; it was its binding agent.

He saw, with a cold, clarifying certainty, what Cathcart’s role was. The Permanent Secretary was not navigating by his own secret star. He was the cartographer, drawing MacAulay a map that led to this room, to this choice, making the inevitable seem like a series of sensible, incremental decisions. *Test the ground.* The ground was quicksand.

He stood up. Haddon, still seated, looked up at him, a faint line of irritation between his brows.

“This is not a negotiation, Prime Minister,” MacAulay said. “It is an ultimatum. I don’t accept ultimatums before lunch.”

“Sit down, First Minister. This is not the time for theatre.”

“It’s the only time for it.” MacAulay pushed his chair in, the legs scraping softly on the parquet. “You’ve presented your package. I will consider it. But I will consider it alongside the Gibraltar fire, and the structure of Vulcan Holdings, and the question of why a project of ‘national’ importance requires a casting vote from one parliament over another. I will consider the debris.”

Haddon’s face hardened. The porcelain mask was gone, replaced by the granite beneath. “Be very careful. You are playing with a live wire. That grid is your legacy. Without it, you are a footnote. A man who talked about windmills.”

“Maybe,” MacAulay said, moving towards the door. “But I’d rather be a footnote who could read the small print than a chapter heading in someone else’s book.”

He left the room, closing the door softly on the smell of beeswax and crumbling shortbread. The private secretary in the outer office looked up, startled. MacAulay did not speak. He walked down the corridor, his footsteps echoing in the marbled silence, the two stones in his pockets now feeling not like choices, but like a single, intolerable burden.

*

He did not return to his Whitehall flat. He told his driver to take him to King’s Cross. He bought a ticket for the next train to Edinburgh with his own credit card, a mundane, traceable act that felt, perversely, like a secret. He needed the three hours of suspension, the limbo of the journey, the anonymous thrum of the train.

He sat in a standard-class window seat, watching the London sprawl give way to fields still winter-bare. The meeting replayed in his mind, not in words, but in sensations: the cloying vanilla, the cold leather, the crumble of shortbread on dark wood. Haddon’s shift from warmth to granite. It was the revelation of a boundary. The Prime Minister had expected a negotiation over the size of the leash. He had not expected the leash itself to be questioned.

His government phone buzzed once, a message from Cathcart. *Hope the meeting was productive. Shall we discuss outcomes this evening?* The neutrality of it was a masterpiece. MacAulay did not reply.

The secret phone remained silent. A blank slate. He took it out, held it in his palm. It was light, a dead weight. He had thrown a chip of stone in the Cabinet Room. It was time to throw the whole thing, or to walk away from the cliff edge.

He typed a message, not to the woman, but to the number that had sent the coordinates of the safe house. *Gibraltar fire confirmed as pressure point. Haddon reacted. What is Vulcan’s true stake?*

He sent it. The act was irrevocable. He was no longer testing the ground. He was digging in it.

The reply came forty minutes later, as the train sped through the rain-smeared outskirts of Newcastle. *Vulcan is a conduit. Not a stakeholder. The stake belongs to a private pension fund for senior Crown service. Fire erased the trail of fee extraction. The grid guarantees the fund’s yield for 30 years. Your oversight board protects the conduit.*

MacAulay read it three times. The cold in his gut was not shock, but confirmation. It was not about energy, or sovereignty, or even political advantage. It was a pension scheme. A golden, unbreakable, thirty-year annuity for the mandarins and the ministers, funded by Scottish wind and guaranteed by the British state. The corruption was so vast, so bureaucratic, it was almost elegant. It wasn’t a backroom bribe; it was a structural inevitability. The grid would be built to serve a ledger. The nation was a side-effect.

He looked at his reflection in the darkening window. He saw the face of a man who had just understood the true anatomy of power. It was not a beast of passion and conspiracy. It was a self-perpetuating mechanism, a slow, patient engine that converted principle into yield, and dissent into debris. What could you live without? They had learned to live without conscience. It was the one limb the mechanism had surgically, collectively removed.

*

His Edinburgh flat was dark, filled with the city’s metallic night chill. He did not turn on the main lights. He poured a whisky, a full measure, and drank it standing by the balcony door. The burn was not cleansing; it was an accent, a highlight to the bitterness.

He had a name. He had a direction. He had a stone of undeniable heft. And he had nowhere to throw it that would not bury him in the rubble.

If he exposed it, using the secret channel, it would be denied. Vulcan would produce new, clean paperwork. The pension fund would be a patriotic investment vehicle. He would be the nationalist conspiracy theorist, sabotaging a national project for political gain. Haddon would be ‘disappointed’, the fast-track would vanish, the grid would be delayed for a decade, and he would be the man who killed it. His career would be over, and the mechanism would churn on, slightly adjusted, mildly inconvenienced.

If he accepted the package, he became part of the conduit. He would be the respectable face on the prospectus. He would deliver the grid, and his legacy would be a power station feeding a bank account.

If he walked away, resigned, he would be a martyr to a cause no one would understand. A footnote about principles in a world that traded only in outcomes.

He was trapped in the Cabinet Room’s geometry still, every path leading back to a version of defeat.

The secret phone buzzed again. A new message. *The crack is not in the deal. It is in the people who broker it. Cathcart’s knighthood was gazetted six months after the Gibraltar fire. For ‘services to public/private finance’. The honour is not a reward. It is a receipt.*

MacAulay closed his eyes. The man in the garden. *Find the crack.* They were not offering him a crack. They were showing him that Cathcart *was* the crack. The loyal servant, the neutral guide, was a paid component. A receipt had been issued.

He thought of Cathcart arranging invisible lint, speaking of overrides and technical concerns. A man navigating by a star called a pension fund.

A plan, cold and ruthless, began to form. It was not a moral plan. It was an anatomical one. It involved using one part of the mechanism against another. It involved not throwing his stone at the edifice, but placing it carefully, precisely, inside the gears.

He went to his desk. He opened his laptop. He began to draft two letters. The first was to the Prime Minister, a model of constructive ambiguity. *Thank you for the frank discussion. My officials will engage on the oversight board model, with a focus on clarifying the casting vote mechanism. I remain committed to the fast-track.* It was a holding move. It would keep the door open, keep Cathcart in the game.

The second letter was to the Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament. He requested an emergency ministerial statement in two days’ time, on the topic of ‘Transparency in Major Public Contracts’. The title was a bland shield. The content was not yet written.

He saved both drafts. He did not send them.

He took out the grey folder. He looked at the handwritten note. *Ask about the fire.* He had asked. Now he had the answer. He needed the proof. Not the evidence, which could be forged or lost, but the testimony. The crack had to speak.

He picked up the secret phone. His message was short. *I need to understand the nature of the receipt. Can the source be approached?*

The reply was almost immediate. *High risk. Source is insulated. But pressure on the conduit may cause a leak. The oversight board talks are your pressure point. A reluctant signatory creates uncertainty. Uncertainty frightens investors who expect certainty.*

MacAulay understood. He had to become the reluctant signatory. He had to drag the talks out, introduce his own feigned concerns, his own technical obfuscations. He had to make the guaranteed yield look less guaranteed. He had to make Cathcart, the broker, sweat. A sweating man might make a mistake. A sweating man might need to reassure his own masters. A sweating man might, if pushed to the brink, seek a lifeline from another direction.

He would have to dance with Cathcart, closer and closer, a waltz of mutual suspicion, until one of them slipped.

He finished the whisky. The decision was made. It was not about morality, or legacy, or clean conscience. It was about surgery. He would operate on the mechanism from the inside, using its own tools, hoping to sever one corrupted limb without the patient bleeding out on the table.

He went to the balcony. The night was clear and pitiless, the stars sharp as diamond points. Down in the New Town, a police siren wailed, a tiny human sound against the cosmic silence. He was no longer a man with a stone in his pocket. He was a man who had swallowed the stone, letting its weight anchor him in the dark tide. He would become the uncertainty. He would become the risk.

The hook for the next chapter was not a countdown, or a meeting. It was a conversation over a perfectly poured gin and tonic in a private club, where Sir Jeremy Cathcart would smile his neutral smile and ask, with genuine professional curiosity, what it would take to get the First Minister’s signature. And Alistair MacAulay would begin to lie, beautifully and precisely, about the price of his soul.

# Chapter 17

## **CHAPTER 17**

The gin was not Scottish either. It was a London gin, distilled to a point of tasteless purity, served in a chilled glass at a table that felt adrift in the amber gloom of the club. The leather was the colour of old blood, the wood dark with the patina of a century’s worth of murmured confidences. Sir Jeremy Cathcart stirred his own drink, the ice tinkling a single, precise note. The sound was a full stop in the quiet.

“I must say, First Minister, your office was rather cryptic about the agenda for our little drink. ‘Clarification on the oversight board’s remit.’ It sounded suspiciously like work.” Cathcart’s smile was a professional tool, deployed to put the other person at ease by acknowledging the absurdity of the pretence. They were both here to work.

Alistair MacAulay took a slow sip. The gin was cold, astringent, a surgical spirit. “Everything is work, Jeremy. Even this. Especially this. I find the proposed remit… problematically broad.”

“Broad?” Cathcart’s head tilted a degree, the polished neutrality giving way to a flicker of genuine professional interest. A problem to be defined was a problem to be solved. “The memorandum was quite specific. The board oversees the operational integrity of the fund. It ensures the guaranteed yield mechanism functions without political interference. A firewall. You were, I recall, adamant about a firewall.”

“Aye. A firewall. Not a bricked-up window.” MacAulay set his glass down on a brass coaster, the sound a soft *thud* in the muffled room. “Your draft gives the board unilateral audit powers over any Scottish Government expenditure with even a tangential link to the fund’s underlying assets. That’s not oversight. That’s a veto dressed in a sub-clause. You could paralyse a hospital procurement if you argued the construction firm was part of a pension portfolio three holding companies removed.”

Cathcart’s smile didn’t waver, but it cooled, like a lamp turned down. “Transparency requires light, First Minister. And light, by its nature, spreads. The investors’ concern is systemic risk. A bad contract here, a corner cut there… it can undermine confidence in the entire architecture. They are buying certainty. We are selling it. Certainty is expensive. It requires… comprehensive assurance.”

MacAulay leaned back, letting the old leather sigh around him. He was a man with a stone in his gut, and its weight made him still. “Then we have a different understanding of the product. I thought we were selling a financial instrument. Not a sovereignty instrument.”

The word hung in the air between them: *sovereignty*. It was the stone he had thrown into the still pool of their negotiation. Cathcart’s eyes dropped to his glass, as if reading the future in the melting ice. “That is a provocative term.”

“It’s an accurate one. You’re not asking for a seat at the table, Jeremy. You’re asking for the right to inspect the kitchen, interview the chef, and approve the menu before we’re allowed to feed ourselves. That’s not a partnership. It’s a receivership.”

Cathcart took a long, slow drink. When he looked up, the professional curiosity was back, sharper. “What would make it palatable?”

This was the moment. The beginning of the lie. It had to be beautiful, precise, and just selfish enough to be believable. It had to be a price for his soul that a man like Cathcart could understand.

MacAulay let a silence build, a show of reluctant calculation. He traced a finger through the condensation on his glass. “The audit trigger,” he said, his voice low, almost confessional. “It can’t be unilateral. A dual-key mechanism. A concern is raised by the board, but an investigation requires the sign-off of the Scottish Finance Secretary. A Scottish minister retains the final say on what constitutes a legitimate inquiry into Scottish governance.”

Cathcart’s expression was a masterclass in quiet dismay. “That reintroduces the political interference the firewall is designed to prevent.”

“It reintroduces *accountability*,” MacAulay countered, his tone hardening just a fraction. “To the parliament in Edinburgh, not just the boardroom in Mayfair. Without that, you’re asking me to sign a document that makes me a viceroy, not a First Minister. My political opponents would fillet me. And rightly so.” He paused, letting the political reality sink in. “The guaranteed yield is a crown jewel. But if the price is wearing the crown while someone else holds the sword, the transaction becomes… unwise. For me.”

There it was. Not principle, but prudence. Not national interest, but political survival. A language Cathcart spoke fluently.

Cathcart steepled his fingers, his gaze turning inward, assessing. “A dual-key. It creates delay. Uncertainty.”

“It creates due process,” MacAulay said softly. “A small delay for a great deal of political cover. My signature becomes… obtainable. For that.”

“And the composition of the board itself?” Cathcart asked, moving to the next point, testing the boundaries of the negotiation. “The draft specifies two members appointed by the investor consortium, one by the UK Treasury, one by the Scottish Government.”

“I want the Scottish appointment to be the chair,” MacAulay said, the demand landing with a quiet thud.

“Impossible.”
“Then make them co-chairs. With the casting vote residing in the… independent member.” He waved a hand, a gesture of apparent concession. “The one appointed by mutual consent. The one who is, presumably, actually independent.”

Cathcart’s eyes narrowed a fraction. He was recalculating. The First Minister was not refusing to sell; he was haggling over the protections built into his own servitude. This was familiar ground. This was manageable. “The casting vote is a significant lever.”

“It’s a face-saving device,” MacAulay sighed, as if weary of the game. “A symbol. The real power is in the audit. Give me the dual-key on the audit, and the chairmanship is a theatre we can argue about later. I need something to take back to my cabinet, Jeremy. Something that looks like a win. Or this…” He gestured between them with his glass. “This all becomes academic. The talks stall. The review is noted. The fund remains a theoretical model. And your investors’ certainty evaporates before the ink is dry on their prospectus.”

He saw it then, the first faint sheen of professional concern on Cathcart’s imperturbable surface. Not sweat, not yet. But a tightening. A man whose entire purpose was the smooth facilitation of a done deal, facing the spectre of friction.

“You’re introducing conditionality where none was envisaged,” Cathcart said, his voice a degree cooler.

“I’m introducing reality,” MacAulay replied. “You’ve dealt with devolution before. You know the dance. Nothing is given without a token being taken. The token here is a shred of perceived control. Give me that, and the mechanism proceeds. The yield is guaranteed. The money flows. The only thing that changes is the speed of the ink drying on my signature.”

Cathcart finished his gin and tonic. The ice settled in the empty glass. He did not signal for another. “I will need to consult. The dual-key proposal… it will be seen as a material change.”

“Consult,” MacAulay said, nodding as if he had expected nothing less. “But consult quickly. My cabinet meets on Thursday. I’d like to have something to temper the… more sceptical voices. Fergus Knox is already calling it a ‘corporate bailiff’s charter’. I need ammunition, Jeremy. Not obstacles.”

The name ‘Knox’ was another carefully placed stone. Cathcart’s file on the Finance Secretary would be thick, annotated with words like ‘unpredictable’, ‘populist’, ‘dangerous’. A plausible source of resistance that had nothing to do with MacAulay’s own hidden calculus.

“I understand,” Cathcart said, rising. He adjusted his cuffs, a tiny, automatic gesture of restoration. “I will be in touch before Thursday. This was a useful conversation. It is always better to understand the true topography of the terrain.”

They shook hands, Cathcart’s grip dry and firm. MacAulay’s was cool from the glass. No warmth passed between them.

“Aye,” MacAulay said, releasing his hand. “The terrain. Watch for the bogs.”

He waited until Cathcart’s figure had been absorbed by the gloom of the club’s hallway before sitting back down. He did not order another drink. He sat in the silence, feeling the weight inside him, the anchor he had swallowed. The lie was now in play. It had a shape, a logic. It was a feint, a demand for a procedural fig leaf that would, he hoped, make Cathcart and his masters push harder on their end, lean more heavily on their conduits, apply more pressure to make this reluctant signatory comply. Pressure caused leaks. Leaks revealed sources.

But as he sat there, a colder thought seeped in. What if his lie was not the only one on the table? What if Cathcart’s consultation was not about resistance, but about acceleration? What if the ‘material change’ was a welcome one, providing the perfect cover for something else?

His phone vibrated in his pocket. A message from Isla, his private secretary. *Security sweep of your residence is complete. All clean. One anomaly: a minor, intermittent fault detected on the landline for the last 72 hours. Engineers found no cause. Likely a glitch in the exchange.*

He stared at the words. *Intermittent fault*. A glitch. Or a listening device too sophisticated for the standard sweep to find, one that powered on and off in random bursts to avoid detection. A device that would not be planted by Cathcart’s people—they would never risk a direct breach of the First Minister’s home. That was the realm of other players. Players for whom a financial mechanism was just one piece on a larger board.

The stone in his gut felt heavier. He was not just dancing with Cathcart. The music was changing, and other dancers were joining the floor, their steps unseen in the dark. He had begun to lie to expose a truth. But the truth, it seemed, was a hall of mirrors, and his own reflection was starting to distort.

He left the club. The London night was damp, the drizzle returned, clinging to his coat like a cold sweat. He looked up at the sky, a dull orange dome of reflected light. No stars. No clean, pitiless clarity. Just the smear of a city that traded in shadows.

The hook for the next chapter was not a consultation, or a cabinet meeting. It was a report on his desk the next morning, a routine update from the government’s internal security unit. A single line buried on page four: *Following the anomaly at the First Minister’s residence, a pattern review of other ministerial and senior civil service communications was initiated. A similar intermittent fault pattern was identified in the landline records of the private office of the Permanent Secretary, Sir Jeremy Cathcart, for a matching 72-hour period.* They were both being listened to. By the same third party. Which meant the private club, the polished lies, the careful negotiation—all of it was already someone else’s script. And MacAulay had just spoken his lines perfectly.



---

# Chapter 18

## **CHAPTER 18**

The report on his desk the next morning smelled of toner and stale air. It was a bland document, a sheaf of A4 bound in a grey cover, titled *Quarterly Communications Integrity Summary*. It had the bureaucratic perfume of something designed to be ignored. MacAulay had read it standing at the window of his Whitehall office, watching the morning traffic clot along the Thames. He read it once, then again, the words not changing, only their meaning deepening, like a stone dropped into a dark pool.

*…a similar intermittent fault pattern was identified in the landline records of the private office of the Permanent Secretary, Sir Jeremy Cathcart…*

The stone in his gut, that familiar lodestar of dread, did not drop. It crystallised. It became a hard, cold fact. The private club, the brandy, the elegant dance of mutual exposure—it had all been performed on a stage they hadn’t built, under a light they hadn’t switched on. They were not two predators circling each other in a private clearing. They were specimens in a shared tank, being observed by a hand they could not see.

He placed the report down carefully, aligning its edges with the leather blotter. The victory of the previous night—the grim satisfaction of having hooked Cathcart, of forcing the man’s polished mechanism to stutter—was ash. It was worse than ash; it was a prop. He had been playing for leverage, for a sliver of control in a game he was only beginning to map. But the map was wrong. The control was an illusion. The game was several layers deeper, and he and Cathcart were not opposing players. They were pieces on the same square, their supposed conflict a distraction for the real move being made elsewhere.

Power did not just corrupt. It compartmentalised. It nested. He had been fixated on the corruption of a man, a ministry, a financial sleight-of-hand. He had missed the architecture. This was not about a single mechanism being perverted. It was about the very space in which mechanisms were built being owned. Someone was listening to the listener. Monitoring the monitor. And that changed everything.

He did not summon Cathcart. To do so would be to perform again, to speak lines into a live microphone. Instead, he did nothing. He attended the morning briefing on the devolution review, his questions neutral, his demeanour that of a man mildly preoccupied with constitutional minutiae. He watched Cathcart, who was, as ever, a masterpiece of attentive blankness. The Permanent Secretary offered a clarification on funding formulae, his voice a smooth instrument of authority. MacAulay watched his hands, the way they rested on the polished table. No tremor. No tell. Either the man did not yet know his own office was compromised, or he knew and his professionalism was a wall of sheer ice. MacAulay suspected the former. A man like Cathcart would not tolerate a breach of his own sanctum. His anger would be cold, surgical, and entirely personal. The fact he was proceeding as normal suggested the security report had not yet reached him, or had been deliberately kept from him.

Which meant the listeners were not Cathcart’s people. And they were not MacAulay’s. They were a third party, one with the reach to bypass the security of both the First Minister of Scotland and the Permanent Secretary of the Scotland Office. The list of entities with that capability was vanishingly short. And it did not include any faction with a purely financial interest.

The meeting ended. MacAulay returned to his office and closed the door. The silence was a held breath. He looked at the phone on his desk, a sleek, government-issue unit. A glitch in the exchange. He thought of the stone in his hand, the clean decision. Throw it, or don’t. There was no stone for this. Only wires, and ghosts in the wires.

He needed a voice that could not be heard on a wire. He needed a conversation that left no trace in an exchange. He needed granite and salt air.

“I’m taking an hour,” he said to his private secretary, pulling on his coat. “Personal time. I’ll be mobile if the sky falls in.”

He left the building not by the front entrance, where the press pool loitered, but through a service corridor that led to a small courtyard used for deliveries. He walked, turning without pattern, his collar up against the damp. He bought a cheap pay-as-you-go phone from a newsagent on a side street, paying with cash from his wallet, the notes damp from the London air. He walked until he found a small, dank public garden, empty save for a man feeding pigeons crusts of bread from a paper bag. He sat on a bench slick with condensation, the iron cold through his trousers.

He dialled a number he knew by heart, one that rang in a cottage looking out over the Minch.

It was answered on the third ring. “Aye?”

The voice was like a physical blow. It was his older brother, Calum. It was home. It was a world where a fault in the line was a thing to be fixed with a spanner and a curse, not a symptom of a silent war.

“Calum. It’s me.”
A pause. A crackle on the line that was just the distance. “Alistair. You’re on a bad line. Or a strange one.”
“Aye. Listen. I need you to do something. I need you to go to the old boathouse. Do you have a pen?”
“I have my head. Speak.”
MacAulay gave him a name. A London number. “Call it from the landline in the boathouse. Ask for Euan. Tell him the grouse is flying blind. Tell him I need the weather. He’ll know what it means. Then hang up. Don’t call me back. I’ll call you on this number tomorrow, same time.”
“The grouse is flying blind,” Calum repeated, his voice flat. “You’re in trouble.”
“It’s not that kind of trouble.”
“All trouble is that kind of trouble. I’ll do it.”
“Thank you.”
“Alistair.” Calum’s voice hardened. “Is it political?”
“It’s the kind of politics that doesn’t end at the ballot box.”
Another silence. He could hear the wind off the sea in the background. A clean wind. “Then watch your back. And your front. And what’s under your feet.”
The line went dead. MacAulay sat for a moment, the cheap plastic phone heavy in his hand. Euan was a relic, a friend from university who had taken a different path, into the shadowed world of signals intelligence before leaving, disillusioned and dangerously knowledgeable. He was a man who understood the ghosts in the wires. *The weather*. A request for a sense of the electronic landscape, of who might be listening, and how.

He dismantled the phone, removing the battery and the SIM card. He dropped the pieces into three separate litter bins on his walk back to Whitehall. The act felt both absurdly theatrical and utterly necessary. It was the new ritual. The new weight in the hand.

Back in his office, the official world had continued in his absence. Papers for signing. A draft statement on fisheries. An invitation to a reception at the French Embassy. The mundane machinery of state. He worked through it, his signature a steady, automatic scrawl. He was building a performance of normalcy, brick by bureaucratic brick. He was the First Minister, concerned with quotidian governance. He was not a man who had just used his brother as a dead drop.

The performance was interrupted just after four o’clock. His private secretary entered, her face carefully composed. “First Minister. Sir Jeremy Cathcart is here. He says it’s urgent, but informal.”

MacAulay felt the crystallised stone shift inside him. *He knows*. “Show him in.”

Cathcart entered, closing the door softly behind him. He did not take a seat. He stood before the desk, and for the first time, MacAulay saw a fissure in the polished neutrality. It was not in his face, which was as composed as ever, but in his stillness. It was the absolute, motionless stillness of a man containing a violent reaction.

“First Minister.” The voice was pared back, stripped of its usual lubricating courtesy. “A curious thing. My head of office security received a routine data-share from your government’s internal security unit this afternoon. A cross-referencing exercise. It contained a detail. A minor anomaly in my office landline records.”

MacAulay said nothing. He waited.

“An intermittent fault pattern,” Cathcart continued, his eyes fixed on a point just above MacAulay’s head. “Matching the one detected at your residence. For the same seventy-two-hour period.” He finally looked at MacAulay. The grey eyes were like chips of flint. “Would you care to comment?”

“You read the same report I did, Jeremy.”
“I did. And the conclusion is inescapable. We have been subject to identical, sophisticated surveillance. By a party unknown to either of us.”
“That’s one conclusion,” MacAulay said, leaning back in his chair. “The other is that one of us is lying about being surveilled. Manufacturing a pattern to cover their own tracks.”

Cathcart’s blink was slow, deliberate. “A possibility I considered. And dismissed. The technique required to generate that specific fault signature—randomised, intermittent, bypassing standard sweeps—is not commercially available. It is the hallmark of a state-level capability. Or a contractor with equivalent resources. My people do not possess it. I assume, with respect, yours do not either.”

“You assume a lot.”
“I am paid to assume correctly. This changes the calculus, First Minister.”
“Does it?” MacAulay let a note of cold anger into his voice. “Or does it just mean our private conversation last night was anything but private? That our… understanding… was brokered in a room full of unseen ears?”

For a fleeting moment, something raw flickered in Cathcart’s eyes. It was the fury of a man whose control had been violated. It was, MacAulay realised, entirely genuine. “Precisely,” Cathcart said, the word clipped. “Which renders our previous discussion not merely moot, but potentially hazardous. We were performing a pantomime of negotiation for an audience we did not invite. Our positions, our concessions, our points of leverage—all are now known. To a third party whose interests are a mystery.”

MacAulay stood up, turning to the window. The afternoon light was failing, the sky a bruised yellow. “So we stop the pantomime. We stop the dance. You came here for a reason, Jeremy. It wasn’t to compare security reports. What do you want?”

“I want to know who is in the room with us,” Cathcart said quietly. “I do not appreciate being eavesdropped upon. It is… unprofessional. And it introduces a variable that threatens the stability of the mechanism we discussed.”

*The mechanism*. The financial instrument. The thing that was to save the books and bind their fates. Even now, under this new threat, his mind went to the machinery. The corruption was not just of power, but of priority. The system’s integrity came first.

“Forget the mechanism,” MacAulay said, turning back. “It’s compromised. If they heard us discuss it, they own it. They can expose it, manipulate it, or simply use the knowledge of it to pull our strings. We can’t proceed.”

“We must proceed,” Cathcart countered, his voice regaining a sliver of its steel. “But on a different basis. A defensive one. If we are both targets of the same external surveillance, then our interests, for the moment, align. We have a common adversary. We need to identify them. And we need to do so discreetly.”

“You’re proposing an alliance.” MacAulay almost laughed. “You and me. Against the ghosts in the wires.”
“I am proposing a temporary, tactical collaboration for mutual security. You have resources in Scotland—your security unit, your police. I have access to… other channels. Together, we might trace the source. Separately, we are blind men in a maze, and the walls are listening.”

It was a cold, logical offer. It was also a trap. To collaborate with Cathcart was to step deeper into the hall of mirrors, to trust a reflection that had already proven false. But to refuse was to remain alone in the dark, with a listener who had no face at all.

“What channels?” MacAulay asked.
“That is not something I will disclose. Not yet. Suffice to say, if this is a state-level capability, there are ways to sense the shape of it. To feel for the pressure in the dark.”
“And in return?”
“In return, we reinstate the understanding from last night. We proceed with the financial instrument, but with added layers of encryption, dead drops, analogue protocols. We make it invisible to digital eavesdroppers. We save your budget, and we preserve my project. And we do it not as adversaries, but as partners securing a mutual asset from a common threat.”

The offer was elegantly corrupt. It used the external threat to cement their crooked alliance. It transformed their vulnerability into a new bond, stronger because it was forged in shared paranoia. This was how power truly corrupted: not with a blunt offer of evil, but with a compelling argument for necessary compromise. *Join me, or we both fall to the thing in the shadows.*

MacAulay was silent for a long time. He let the weight of it settle. He thought of the stone. There was no throw, no don’t throw. There was only the slow, inexorable sinking.
“I’ll consider it,” he said finally. “I need to consult my own people.”
“Of course,” Cathcart said, the neutrality returning, smoothing over the fissure. “But time, as you know, is a factor. The devolution review looms. And our unseen friend is presumably still listening. I would advise a decision within twenty-four hours.”

He gave a slight, formal nod and left the room, closing the door with the same soft precision.

MacAulay sank into his chair. The performance was over. The new reality was in place. He had gone from hunting Cathcart, to being hunted with him. The power he sought to expose had just enveloped him, offering protection from a greater, darker power. It was a Russian doll of corruption, each layer revealing a smaller, more intricate version of the same malevolent design.

He waited until the building was quiet, the civil service day drained away. He used the newly-swept landline on his desk to call his driver. “The residence, please.”

The car was a capsule of silence. The London night was fully formed, a sodium-lit gloom. The drizzle had ceased, leaving the streets with a sickly, reflective shine. He did not look out. He looked inward, at the chessboard that had just been upended. He and Cathcart were no longer kings. They were pawns who had just realised the game was being played on two boards at once.

At his residence, he went through the motions. He ate a meal prepared by the staff, tasting nothing. He reviewed papers. He watched the ten o’clock news, a parade of other people’s certainties. At eleven, he excused himself and went to his private study, a small, book-lined room on the first floor. He locked the door.

From a locked drawer in his desk, he took out another cheap phone, a twin to the one he had destroyed. He powered it on. He waited.

The call came at five minutes past midnight. The screen showed *Number Withheld*. He connected it.

“Weather report.” It was Euan’s voice, thinned by encryption and distance. It sounded like it was coming from the bottom of a well.
“Go ahead.”
“A low-pressure system. Extensive. Centred on the usual metropolitan areas. Sophisticated gear. Military-grade. Not ours. Not GCHQ’s standard kit. This is the good stuff. The export-controlled, deniable, ‘fell off the back of an ally’s lorry’ stuff. The pattern is consistent with a nodal intercept strategy. They’re not just listening to you. They’re mapping the network. Who you call, who calls you, the timing, the duration. Building a web. The content is almost secondary.”
“Who?”
A long, static-filled pause. “Hard to say. The signature has… echoes. A blend of techniques. Israeli precision, American scale, Russian patience. A hybrid. Private contractor, almost certainly. But one with a government’s chequebook and a blank slate for a moral code.”
“Purpose?”
“Mapping. Influence. Leverage. With this level of access, they’re not just gathering intelligence. They’re preparing the ground. For what, I can’t say. But when you own the wires, you can make people hear what you want them to hear. You can make truths disappear. You can make ghosts speak.” Another pause. “Alistair. This is deep water. You’re not just being watched. You’re being *instrumentalised*. Your connections, your authority—they’re being catalogued as potential tools. Get out of the game. However you can.”
“It’s too late for that.”
“Then God help you. The weather is set in. No break expected.” The line went dead.

MacAulay placed the phone on the desk. *Instrumentalised*. His connections. Cathcart was a connection. Their financial mechanism was a connection. The devolution review was a connection. He was a node in a web being mapped by a spider he could not see. And Cathcart’s offer—to collaborate, to use his ‘channels’—was he trying to find the spider? Or was he trying to find the web’s control terminal, so he could claim it for himself?

He thought of the line from the report. *A similar intermittent fault pattern… in the landline records of the private office of Sir Jeremy Cathcart*. What if it wasn’t a breach? What if it was a receipt? Proof of purchase. What if Cathcart, or the forces he represented, had *hired* the listeners? And the discovery of the fault was not a security lapse, but a staged reveal, a way to force this very alliance, to bind MacAulay closer under the guise of a shared threat? It was a level of duplicity that made his head swim. It was the corruption of truth itself, turning reality into a weapon.

He had no proof. Only the cold, multiplying paranoia that was the true symptom of the disease. Power corrupted by creating worlds within worlds, lies within lies, until the very act of seeking truth made you a part of the fiction.

He looked at the phone. He had twenty-four hours to give Cathcart an answer. An answer that would be heard, either by the ghosts, or by the ghost-maker.

He made his decision not out of courage, but out of a sheer, stubborn refusal to be a tool. If he was to be instrumentalised, he would be a flawed instrument. A stone in the mechanism.

He would agree to Cathcart’s alliance. He would walk into the proposed collaboration. But he would do so not to trace the source of the surveillance. He would do it to trace the source of Cathcart’s knowledge. To follow the Permanent Secretary’s ‘channels’ back to their origin. He would pretend to hunt the spider, while watching the man who claimed to be hunting beside him. He would use the alliance to expose the ally.

It was a plan built on quicksand. It required him to lie better, to trust less, to become a more perfect reflection of the corruption he fought. He would have to become a ghost in the web, a silent node broadcasting false data.

He picked up the official phone, the one that was possibly clean, possibly not. He dialled Cathcart’s private line. It was answered immediately.

“Jeremy. I’ve considered your proposal.”
“Yes?”
“I’m in. We find who’s listening. Then we proceed.”
A pause, then a sound that might have been the faintest exhalation of satisfaction. “Wise. I’ll make the initial discreet enquiries on my side. I suggest you do the same. We’ll compare notes tomorrow evening. Discreetly.”
“Where?”
“The club was compromised. We’ll need a new venue. Somewhere with no wires at all. I’ll text you a location. Burner phone.”
“Understood.”
The call ended. MacAulay sat in the quiet of the study. He had just stepped from one script into another, deeper one. He had traded the role of reluctant conspirator for the role of double agent in a play where he didn’t know the author, the audience, or the ending.

He looked at his hands, resting on the polished wood. They were clean. They had signed papers, shaken hands, lifted a glass of brandy. They had never felt less his own. The weight he carried now was not the simple heft of a stone. It was the formless, crushing pressure of the entire edifice, of every lie spoken in every panelled room, of every truth twisted into a tool. It was the weight of the machine. And he was now a cog, deliberately misaligned, waiting for the whole damned thing to tear itself apart.

# Chapter 19

## **CHAPTER 19**

The location Cathcart sent was a glass-walled café in the middle of the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum. It was a masterstroke. The space was a cathedral of noise—the echoing clatter of cups, the shriek of children dragged past Victorian landscapes, the murmur of a hundred tourists in a dozen languages. It was a place where no electronic ear could isolate a single conversation from the cacophony. The glass walls meant they could see anyone approaching from any direction. There were no corners, no shadows, only the exposed, public glare of civic enlightenment.

MacAulay arrived early, buying a terrible coffee and taking a table beside a case of iridescent Art Nouveau jewellery. He watched the main entrance. Cathcart appeared precisely on time, a grey heron picking its way through the flock of visitors. He carried a museum guidebook and a small paper bag from the gift shop.

“First Minister.” Cathcart sat, placing the bag on the table between them. “A small gift. For your granddaughter. A stuffed Highland coo. It seemed… apt.”

MacAulay didn’t touch the bag. “Is it wired, Jeremy? Or just a symbol?”

Cathcart’s smile was thin, professional. “It is a toy. A gesture of goodwill in a venue devoid of it. Shall we?” He opened his guidebook. Inside, nestled in a hollow cut from the pages, was a slim manila folder. “My initial findings. As promised.”

MacAulay didn’t reach for it. He sipped his coffee, letting the bitterness coat his tongue. “You first.”

“Of course.” Cathcart’s voice dropped, blending into the ambient din. “The surveillance on your official line is sophisticated. Not GCHQ standard-issue. It has a… commercial flavour. The architecture suggests a private intelligence firm. One with former government cryptographers on staff. The kind hired for corporate espionage, or by political campaigns in other, less scrupulous democracies.”

“A firm,” MacAulay repeated. “Not a rival department. Not the Cabinet Office.”

“It appears not. The pattern is wrong for in-house work. Too many elegant shortcuts. Civil service work is clunky, thorough, documented. This is sleek, proprietary, deniable.”

“Who hires them?”

“That is the question.” Cathcart’s eyes scanned the room, a practiced, unhurried sweep. “The payment trail is a Russian doll of shell companies. Cayman Islands, Panama, Luxembourg. My channels hit a wall of legal privilege. But the style… it’s not aggressive. It’s not blackmail-oriented. It’s archival. They are building a library of your communications, not trying to trigger a crisis.”

“For what?”

“Leverage. The most dangerous kind. The kind you don’t use until you need to move a mountain. Someone is investing in your future, First Minister. They are buying shares in your political capital, intending to call in the debt at a moment of their choosing.” He nudged the folder an inch closer. “Your turn.”

MacAulay had prepared his lie with the care of a watchmaker. He reached into his inner pocket and withdrew a single sheet of plain paper, folded twice. He slid it across the table. “My people traced a metadata anomaly. The intercepts on my phone are being mirrored. A copy of the copy is being sent to a server cluster registered to a holding company called Palingenesis Holdings. Based in Zurich.”

He watched Cathcart’s face. The name was fiction. The detail was plausible chaff. But the concept—a second layer of surveillance, a watcher watching the watchers—was a poisoned hook. If Cathcart was the spider at the centre, he would react to the suggestion of a rival web.

Cathcart’s expression did not change. He did not blink. He simply opened the folded paper, glanced at the meaningless strings of numbers and fake routing codes, and gave a slow nod. “Interesting. A redundancy. Or a rivalry. This complicates the picture.”

“Or clarifies it,” MacAulay said. “Maybe our private firm is working for someone else. Someone who doesn’t trust their own surveillance. Someone who wants their own, private feed.”

“A sceptical client,” Cathcart murmured, his gaze distant. He carefully re-folded the paper and placed it in his guidebook tomb. “This is valuable. It gives us a new vector. Palingenesis. I will have my channels look into it.”

There it was. No surprise. No alarm. Only the smooth assimilation of new data. The reaction of a man receiving a report, not of a man whose scheme had been discovered. It proved nothing, and everything. Cathcart was either innocent of the surveillance, or he was such a consummate actor that the truth was irrelevant. MacAulay felt the quicksand shift beneath him.

“So what’s the next move?” MacAulay asked, playing his part. “We have two leads. Your commercial firm, my mirrored server.”

“We follow the money,” Cathcart said, closing the guidebook with finality. “My people will continue to unpick the corporate layers of the firm. Yours should dig into the beneficiaries of Palingenesis. We meet again in forty-eight hours. Same level of discretion.”

“And in the meantime? I’m still broadcasting every word to an unknown audience.”

“Then let us give them a performance.” Cathcart’s eyes were cold and bright. “We feed the machine. A carefully constructed narrative. Let them hear you struggling with the devolution review, leaning towards a hardline stance to placate your party’s fundamentalists. Let them hear your doubts about the Union, your private frustrations with London. A portrait of a man under strain, pulled in two directions. It is a mask they will believe. And while they are analysing your fictional crisis, they will be less attentive to the quiet movements in the background.”

It was a smart play. It was what MacAulay would have suggested himself. That was the most unsettling part. “A theatre of the airwaves,” he said.

“Precisely. You have the script. The conflicted nationalist. It should not be a stretch.” Cathcart stood, picking up the gift shop bag and tucking the guidebook under his arm. “For the coo, First Minister. A gesture. Nothing more.”

He melted back into the crowd, leaving MacAulay alone with his cold coffee and the glittering jewellery in the case. The meeting had been flawless. Productive. Collaborative. It had advanced the shared mission. And MacAulay was now certain, with a cold, sinking clarity, that Sir Jeremy Cathcart was lying to him.

The proof was not in what he had said, but in what he had not done. He had not questioned the fake data. He had accepted it without a flicker of personal recognition. A man truly investigating a rogue operation would have been peppered with questions: *How did your people find this? What’s your source? Can I speak to them?* Cathcart had asked none. He had simply collected the intelligence and moved on. He was running a process, not pursuing a truth.

MacAulay left the museum, the autumn Glasgow air a slap after the stuffy warmth inside. He walked, aimless, along the river Kelvin. The water was high and brown, churning with the memory of rain. *A theatre of the airwaves.* He would have to perform now, for an audience he could not see. Every call on his official phone, a soliloquy. Every hesitant pause, a calculated gesture.

He took out his burner phone, the one he’d bought for cash in a shop where the camera was broken. He typed a message to Mhairi, his only fixed point. *Dinner tonight. Your place. Need to talk.* He needed to hear a voice that wasn’t measuring him for a frame. He needed to remember the weight of a real stone.

***

Mhairi’s flat was above a closed bookshop in the West End. The smell of old paper and garlic fought for dominance on the stairwell. She opened the door, flour dusting her forearms, her hair escaping from a loose knot. She didn’t smile. She took one look at his face and stood aside.

“You’re in it deep,” she said, closing the door.

“Aye.”

The living room was small, shelves buckling under books, a good rug on the floor. A pot simmered on the stove. It was the antithesis of the official residence—lived-in, authentic, uncalculated. He felt like a contaminant.

“Wine?” she asked.

“Whisky. If you have it.”

She poured him a dram of an Islay single malt, peat-smoke in a glass. He took it, held the heat in his palm.

“Cathcart,” he said. “The collaboration. It’s a sham. I’m feeding him false information to see where it goes. He’s feeding me a line. We’re two liars dancing in the dark.”

Mhairi leaned against the kitchen doorway, arms crossed. “And the surveillance?”

“Real. He’s using it as the bait. But I think he knows who’s behind it. I think he might *be* behind it. Or he’s their… curator.” He drank the whisky, felt its fire trace a path to his gut. “He gave me a script. To perform for the listeners. To make them think I’m cracking under the pressure.”

“Are you?”

He looked at her. “What do you see?”

She studied him, her gaze unflinching. “I see a man who’s stopped trusting his own shadow. I see a man trying to hold the shape of himself while everything around him tries to mould him into something else. I don’t see a crack. I see a man holding a damn fault line together with his bare hands.”

Tears, hot and stupid, pricked his eyes. He looked away, towards the window and the dark street. “I don’t know what’s true anymore, Mhairi. The office, the title… it’s a fiction. The power is an illusion. The real machinery is underneath, in the dark, and I’m just a puppet on the stage above, thinking my movements matter.”

“They matter to me,” she said, simple and direct. “They matter to the people who didn’t vote for a puppet. You play Cathcart’s script. But you write your own subtext. You use his theatre to hide your real moves.”

“What real moves?” The despair in his voice shocked him. “I’m reacting. I’m parrying. I’m not *doing* anything.”

“You’re learning the shape of the machine,” she said, pushing off the doorframe and coming to sit opposite him. “That’s the first step to breaking it. You can’t swing a sledgehammer in the dark. You need to know where the load-bearing walls are.” She reached out, covered his hand with hers. Her skin was warm, rough from clay and work. “You find the truth. Not about the surveillance, but about the purpose. Who benefits from a First Minister under permanent observation? Who benefits from you being strained, conflicted, compromised? Follow that. Not the technical trail. The human one.”

Her words cut through the fog. He had been obsessed with the *how*—the methods, the tradecraft. He had neglected the *why*. The surveillance was a tool. What was the blueprint?

“The devolution review,” he said slowly. “It’s the catalyst. Everything is pointing towards it. The pressure from London, the whispers in the party, the ‘private chat’ with the PM, now this… archive they’re building of me. They’re preparing for the review. They’re preparing *me* for the review.”

“To do what?”

“To capitulate. Or to explode. Either would serve their purpose.” He saw it now, a ghastly symmetry. “If I cave, if I sign a review that pulls power back to Westminster, I become the Scottish Judas. The SNP tears itself apart. The Union is ‘saved’ by my betrayal. If I refuse, if I dig in and make it a crisis, they have the archive. They leak a selection of my ‘private frustrations’—doctored, contextualised—to paint me as an unstable separatist, a risk to the stability of the UK. They force a vote of no confidence, install someone more… pliable. The outcome is the same. The machine is lubricated for either result.”

Mhairi was silent for a long moment. “Then you need a third option. One their machine isn’t built to process.”

“A stone through the window,” he whispered.

“No,” she said, her grip tightening. “Not a stone. A truth. A single, undeniable, public truth. You need to find the one thing in this whole rotten scheme that is real, and you need to hold it up in the light so bright it burns their eyes out.”

***

The performance began the next morning. In his office, on the official phone, he played his part. He called a trusted backbencher and spoke in a weary, strained tone about the “unsustainable pressures,” the “impossible expectations from both sides.” He let his voice break, just once, on the phrase “the soul of the nation.” He called his private secretary and cancelled a series of minor engagements, citing fatigue. He made sure to do it while standing near the phone on his desk, the one he now thought of as the altar of lies.

He felt dirty. He was manipulating the few people whose trust was genuine, weaving his fiction into their concern. But Mhairi’s idea of a subtext kept him sane. While his voice performed anxiety, his mind was elsewhere. He was looking for the load-bearing wall.

He summoned Ewan Douglas, his most discreet aide, a man with the face of a friendly bank manager and the mind of a chess grandmaster.

“Ewan,” MacAulay said, staring out at the Edinburgh skyline. “Forget everything you know about security audits and data trails. I want a political map. Of the last six months. Every person, from any party, in any government, who has publicly or privately advocated for a ‘reset’ of devolution. Not the think-tank pundits. The players. The ones with skin in the game. Who stands to gain from a weaker Scottish government? Not vaguely. Specifically. Financially. Professionally. What contracts hinge on reserved powers? What careers are stalled by our competence? Build me that map.”

Ewan didn’t ask why. He gave a slow nod. “It’s a different kind of digging. It leaves a different kind of trace.”

“I know. Be a ghost.”

“And if I find a name that… surprises you?”

“Especially then.”

After Ewan left, the silence of the office felt charged. The performance was intermission. The real play was moving in the wings. His burner phone vibrated. A message from an unknown number. *Palingenesis lead cold. Dead ends. My firm’s trail warmer. Suspect involvement of a senior figure with links to defence procurement. More soon. – J.*

MacAulay stared at the message. Defence procurement. It was a new, tantalising thread. It made a kind of sense—the private intelligence firms, the commercial sophistication Cathcart had mentioned. The defence sector was riddled with them. It was also a sector umbilically tied to the British state, to the Union, to massive contracts that were reserved to Westminster. A sector that would view a confident, assertive Scottish government as a risk to budget streams, to strategic control.

Was this Cathcart feeding him a richer, more plausible lie? Or was it a genuine fragment of truth, slipped into the game by accident? The hook was baited with a specific, verifiable sector. It was a test.

He typed a reply. *Understood. Will explore connections on this end. Proceed with caution.* He sent it, then immediately called Mhairi on the burner.

“Defence procurement,” he said without preamble.

He heard her sharp intake of breath. “That’s… big. That’s not just political. That’s the deep state. The money that makes the world go round.”

“It’s also a perfect red herring. Vast, shadowy, impenetrable. A conspiracy theory made flesh. If I start chasing that, I’ll disappear into a labyrinth forever.”

“But?”

“But it’s the first specific thing he’s given me. It has the texture of truth. Because the best lies do.”

“So you follow it. But you don’t go into the labyrinth. You look at the gatekeepers. Who controls the flow of money into that sector? Who in our political firmament has a foot in that world?”

A face surfaced in his memory, from a forgotten briefing note. A Labour peer, once a Minister of State for Defence. A man who sat on the boards of two aerospace consultancies. A man who had written a recent, thoughtful pamphlet for a Unionist think-tank on the “National Security Imperatives of Integrated Governance.” A man who was due to give evidence to the devolution review committee.

“I have a name,” MacAulay said, his voice quiet.

“Then you have a thread. Pull it. Gently.”

The thread led to a charity dinner two nights later at Edinburgh Castle. A black-tie affair for veterans’ support. The great hall was a forest of uniforms and dinner jackets, the stone walls swallowing the sound of clinking glass and low conversation. The air smelled of wood smoke, old stone, and expensive perfume.

MacAulay worked the room, playing his part—the sombre, gracious First Minister, a man bearing the weight of office with a slight, dignified stoop. He saw his target across the room: Lord James Sutcliffe, a tall man with a patrician bearing and a laugh that seemed to be delivered in italics. He was holding court beside a roaring fire.

MacAulay waited, biding his time. He exchanged meaningless pleasantries with a former Chief of the Defence Staff, nodded sympathetically to a widow of a regimental hero. He let the performance breathe.

Finally, a natural gap appeared. He drifted to the fireplace, accepting a glass of claret from a passing waiter. Sutcliffe saw him, his expression shifting into one of polished, political welcome.

“First Minister. A noble cause. Good of you to come.”

“We owe them more than a dinner, James,” MacAulay said, his tone suitably grave. “Especially now. When the world feels increasingly unstable.”

Sutcliffe’s eyes sharpened, just a degree. “Indeed. Security is the foundation of everything. Prosperity, democracy, the very Union itself. It cannot be an afterthought.”

“Aye. And it becomes harder to think strategically when the ground is shifting under your feet.” MacAulay took a sip of wine, looking into the fire. “This devolution review. It’s become a distraction. A debate about process, when the threats are about substance. It saps focus from the real work.”

He felt Sutcliffe’s gaze on his profile. This was the script Cathcart had given him—the strained leader, worried about stability. He was performing it perfectly.

“A strong Union is the ultimate strategic asset,” Sutcliffe said, his voice dropping into a more confidential register. “But strength requires coherence. Unified command. A single, sovereign voice on the world stage. The current… patchwork can be misread. By allies and adversaries alike.”

“Misread as weakness,” MacAulay nodded, as if the thought pained him. “I spend more time managing internal boundaries than external ones. It’s… inefficient.” He let the word hang, a bureaucrat’s lament.

Sutcliffe placed a hand on his shoulder, a gesture of avuncular solidarity. “You’re not alone in seeing it, Alistair. Many of us do. The silos, the duplication, the friction. It’s not good government. And in the realm of defence and security, it’s a potential vulnerability. One that a resolute review could fix. Could streamline.” His hand lifted. “But it takes courage. To put the national interest above the… provincial sentiment.”

*Provincial sentiment.* The phrase was a tiny, gleaming needle in the haystack of platitudes. It was the authentic voice of a certain kind of power, the kind that viewed Scotland as a management problem.

“Courage is in short supply,” MacAulay said, offering a weary smile. “It’s easier to let sleeping dogs lie.”

“Sometimes,” Sutcliffe said, his eyes now fixed on the middle distance, on some vision of streamlined, efficient power, “the dogs need to be put down for the health of the pack.”

The conversation moved on, to the weather, to the quality of the claret. But the hook was set. Sutcliffe’s words were not those of a disinterested peer. They were the words of a man with a blueprint. A man who saw the review not as a negotiation, but as a surgical operation. A man who might very well want a detailed, psychological dossier on the surgeon who would wield the knife—or on the patient who might resist it.

Later, as the dinner broke up, MacAulay stood in the castle courtyard, the night air cold on his face. The performance was over. He had fed the listeners their script. And he had found his thread. Not a technical thread of servers and shell companies, but a human one—a strand of contempt, woven into the fabric of power, leading from a defence lobbyist to the heart of the state.

His burner phone vibrated. A message from Cathcart. *Progress. Firm linked to a subsidiary of Aethon Strategic Solutions. Defence and intelligence consultancy. Board members include former US DoD and UK Cabinet Office. Client list opaque. Moving closer. – J.*

Aethon Strategic Solutions. MacAulay typed the name into his phone. The website was a masterpiece of vague, empowering rhetoric. “Securing Tomorrow’s Landscape Today.” He searched for board members. There, amongst the retired generals and former ambassadors, was a name: The Rt Hon. Lord James Sutcliffe, Advisory Board (Security Policy).

The two threads—the human and the technical—twisted together, forming a single, strong cord. Cathcart had handed him the corporate name. Sutcliffe had provided the human connection. It was too neat. It felt like a gift. A gift wrapped in a trap.

He looked up at the castle, a dark silhouette against the city-lit sky. It was a monument to a history of sieges, of power taken and held by force. He was inside it now, not as a defender, but as a saboteur. He had a name. He had a connection. He had the beginning of a truth.

But as he walked to his car, the weight was still there. It was no longer the formless pressure of the machine. It was the specific, sharp burden of knowledge. He knew a piece of the design. And knowing it made him a target in a new, more dangerous way. The performance was over. The next act was not theatre. It was war, conducted in whispers and shadows. And he had just stepped onto the battlefield.

He got into the back of the car. The driver glanced at him in the mirror. “Back to the residence, First Minister?”

“Aye,” MacAulay said, watching the castle gates recede. “For now.”

But his mind was already elsewhere, tracing the cord from Sutcliffe to Aethon, from Aethon to the surveillance, from the surveillance to Cathcart. He was no longer a cog waiting for the machine to tear itself apart. He was a man with a lever, searching for the place to stand. The truth was no longer an abstract concept. It was a weapon. And he would have to learn how to wield it without it cutting his own hands off.

The car descended into the city, leaving the fortress on the rock behind. Down here, in the tangled streets, the real work began.

# Chapter 20

## **CHAPTER 20**

The residence in Edinburgh was not a home. It was a stage set, dressed with inherited furniture and good Scottish wool carpets that swallowed sound. Alistair MacAulay stood at the window of his study, looking down into the private garden. A sensor light, triggered by some nocturnal creature, flicked on, bleaching a rectangle of manicured lawn. It illuminated nothing but emptiness. He thought of the castle on the rock, a fortress of declared power. This was a fortress of implied power. Both were cages.

The cord of knowledge he now held—Sutcliffe to Aethon, Aethon to the silent, watching infrastructure—was not a lever. Not yet. It was a live wire, snaking back into the dark, and he could feel its lethal potential humming up his arm. To pull on it was to invite a shock. To follow it was to walk into a maze where the walls were made of other men’s reputations, other men’s secrets. A war of whispers. He had the weapon of truth, but truth in this realm was a radioactive isotope: most dangerous to the one who held it unprotected.

He turned from the window. The dossier on Aethon Strategic Solutions was open on his desk, a slim folder of printed pages that felt, in their physicality, like an artefact from a simpler time. “Securing Tomorrow’s Landscape Today.” The vacuity of the phrase was its own armour. He ran a finger down the list of advisory board members. Lords, generals, a former head of MI5. A parliament of ghosts, lending their spectral authority to a corporate entity. Sutcliffe’s name was there, nestled amongst them, a single thread in a tapestry of influence.

The intercom on his desk buzzed, a soft, invasive insect hum.
“First Minister? It’s Moira.” His private secretary’s voice, filtered through the machine, was stripped of its usual warmth, rendered administrative.
“Aye, Moira.”
“Sir Jeremy Cathcart is on the line. He says it’s urgent.”
MacAulay looked at the clock. 11:47 PM. Cathcart did not make social calls. This was either a move, or a reaction.
“Put him through.”

He sat, letting the phone ring twice before lifting the receiver. The weight of the handset was a deliberate, old-world anchor.
“Jeremy. Burning the midnight oil?”
“First Minister. I apologise for the hour.” Cathcart’s voice was smooth, unruffled. It carried no trace of the late hour, or of guilt. “A matter has arisen. The Cabinet Office has forwarded a draft of the terms of reference for the devolution review. The Prime Minister is keen to have your input before it’s finalised tomorrow. He’s asked that I brief you.”
“At midnight.”
“The Prime Minister’s diligence is a round-the-clock affair. As, I’m sure, is yours.” A pause, perfectly measured. “He mentioned he found your last conversation… inconclusive. He wishes to ensure the review is constructed on a foundation of complete mutual understanding.”
The subtext was a physical pressure in the room. *Inconclusive*. Meaning MacAulay had not given the assurances he was meant to give. The ‘private chat’ had been a probe. This was the next application of force.
“Mutual understanding,” MacAulay repeated. “A fine concept. Often confused with unilateral compliance.”
A faint, papery sound, perhaps Cathcart adjusting his spectacles. “I wouldn’t know, First Minister. I am merely the conduit. The draft is extensive. It proposes working groups on fiscal frameworks, legislative competence, reserved powers. The granularity is… impressive.”
“I bet it is.” MacAulay’s eyes were on the Aethon dossier. Granularity. The machine loved granularity. It was how it digested reality, turning principle into process, sovereignty into spreadsheet cells. “And I suppose these working groups will be populated by ‘independent technical experts’?”
“Naturally. To ensure objectivity.”
*People like Aethon*, MacAulay thought. *People who secure tomorrow’s landscape by pouring concrete over anything that grows wild*.
“Send it over,” he said, his voice flat.
“I have a car ready to bring a hard copy. The driver will wait for your annotated return. The Prime Minister wishes to review your thoughts before cabinet at nine.”
The trap was so elegant it was almost beautiful. A request for input, framed as courtesy, delivered under duress. His annotations would be pored over, not for their content, but for their weaknesses, their points of potential fatigue or frustration. It was a psychological assay, disguised as bureaucracy.
“Tell your driver he’ll have a long wait. I read slowly when the text is dense.”
“I’m sure you’ll apply your customary rigour, First Minister. Goodnight.”
The line went dead.

MacAulay replaced the receiver. The silence in the study was absolute. They were tightening the frame around him. The public performance—the debates, the questions in parliament—was the decorative front. The real architecture was being built here, in these late-night calls, in the drafts no one would ever see, in the unminuted conversations between men like Cathcart and companies like Aethon. They were constructing a cage of process, and they were inviting him to polish the bars.

He would not annotate their document. He would not play the conscientious administrator. The lever he needed was not in the terms of a review. It was in the connection. The human connection.

He opened a drawer and took out a clean, unlined notepad and a pen. He began to write, not as the First Minister, but as the man from Lewis who knew the weight of a stone. He wrote down the names from the Aethon board. He drew lines. He circled Sutcliffe. He wrote ‘Cathcart?’ with a question mark so heavy it scored the paper. He needed to turn the connection from a fact into a story. And a story needed a witness, not just a document.

The door to the study opened softly. His wife, Elspeth, stood there, wrapped in a dressing gown. She held two mugs. She didn’t speak, just crossed the room and set one down beside him. Peat-smoke tea. The scent of home.
“The night shift?” she asked, her voice quiet in the vast room.
“The only shift there is.”
She glanced at the notepad, at the scrawled names and angry circles. She had been a journalist, before the role of First Minister’s wife had demanded her silence. She knew the grammar of suspicion.
“You’re mapping ghosts,” she said.
“I’m trying to find the medium. The one who summoned them.”
She sat in the chair opposite the desk, curling her feet beneath her. “Jeremy Cathcart called.”
“Aye.”
“He wants something.”
“He always wants something. Tonight, he wants me to tire myself out reading bureaucratic poison so I’m less able to see the knife.”
Elspeth sipped her tea. “So don’t read it. Do something else.”
“Such as?”
“Talk to a ghost.”

He looked up at her. Her face was pale in the lamplight, her eyes dark and knowing. She had never accepted the performance. She saw the stagehands in the wings.
“Sutcliffe is in London,” MacAulay said. “Surrounded by his own kind. A protected species.”
“Then you don’t talk to Sutcliffe.” She leaned forward. “You find the one who isn’t protected. The one who does the work, not the one who takes the credit. Every board has a chairman. But it has a company secretary, too. It has accountants. It has people who type the minutes and hear the jokes they’re not meant to hear.”
The simplicity of it was a lance of light. He had been thinking like a politician, targeting the source of power. She was thinking like a reporter, targeting the keeper of records.
“Aethon is a fortress,” he said.
“Even fortresses have drains. And things come out of drains.”
A slow smile touched his lips, the first genuine expression in days. He looked at his notepad, at the corporate title. He circled it, then drew a line down from it, off the page. “The plumber.”
“Exactly.”

He pushed the notepad away. The driver with Cathcart’s document could wait until hell froze over. He opened his laptop, the glow painting his face a sickly blue. He began a different kind of search. Not for lords and generals, but for the infrastructure of Aethon itself. Company registration numbers. Filing histories at Companies House. The names of auditors. The corporate architecture was a matter of public record, a dry shell. But within that shell were people.

An hour later, he found a thread. Aethon Strategic Solutions was a subsidiary. Its parent company was registered in Luxembourg. A holding company. But the UK filings required a director’s name for the subsidiary. It was not a lord. It was a woman: Dr. Anya Kiriakov, PhD (Comp. Sci.), M.Sc. (Pol. Sci.). Her address was a post-office box in London. Her listed occupation: ‘Strategic Risk Analyst’. A ghost with a qualifications list.

He cross-referenced the name. A handful of academic papers from a decade ago, on the ethics of algorithmic governance. Then, nothing. A bright mind absorbed into the private shadow-world. A plumber who understood the theory of hydraulics.

“Got you,” he whispered.

He worked through the night, not on Cathcart’s document, but on building a profile from digital dust. Anya Kiriakov had vanished from academia after a fellowship at a defence-funded think tank. She was a cipher. But she was a *specific* cipher. She was the legal face of Aethon in the UK. She would have signed the documents. She would know where the bodies were buried because she would have processed the invoices for the shovels.

As the first grey light touched the window, he made a decision. He could not go to her. He could not summon her. To do so would trigger every alarm in Cathcart’s world. She had to come to him. And she had to believe it was her idea.

He needed bait. Not power, not threat. Something else.

He thought of her papers. *The Moral Calculus of Mass Data*. *Governance as a System: Beyond the Human Agent*. They were the work of an idealist, or perhaps a disillusioned idealist trying to mathematicise a conscience. He closed his eyes, rubbing the grit from them. He had to speak a language she might still remember.

He began to draft an email. Not from his official account. From a blind, anonymous proxy he kept for occasions when the First Minister needed to disappear. The address was a string of numbers at a common provider. The subject line was a question mark. The body was brief, a quote from one of her own papers: *‘When the system renders the human decision obsolete, the only moral act is to interrogate the system’s source code.’*

Below it, he typed: *The code is called Aethon. The interrogation is overdue. A public forum awaits. HM Government’s Devolution Review, Week Three, ‘Technological Sovereignty & Security.’ They will whitewash the code. You can reveal it. No one will protect you if you stay silent. Someone might, if you speak.* He added a time, a date, a committee room number in the Scottish Parliament. Then he deleted the draft. He would not send it from here. The residence was not safe.

The sensor light in the garden flicked off, plunging the rectangle of lawn back into darkness. The night creature had passed. MacAulay stood, his bones aching. He had found his plumber. And he had dug a channel, hoping the truth would flow towards him.

When the car from Cathcart arrived just after seven, the driver was met by Moira. She accepted the thick, bound dossier with a polite smile. “The First Minister is in preparation for First Minister’s Questions. He will review the document in due course.”
“My instructions are to wait for his response,” the driver said, a man in a suit who was more than a driver.
“Then you may wait,” Moira said, her tone sweet and immovable. “The coffee in the staff kitchen is surprisingly good. It might be a long morning.”

Upstairs, MacAulay dressed for battle. The dark suit, the saltire pin. The performance continued. But beneath the costume, the man with the lever was moving. He had placed his stone. Now he had to wait to see what it disturbed.

First Minister’s Questions was a roaring, tribal fury. The opposition leader, a man with the polished aggression of a game-show host, went straight for the throat.
“First Minister! With the UK Government’s devolution review now underway, can he assure this parliament—and the people of Scotland—that he will not barter away a single syllable of this parliament’s hard-won sovereignty in secretive backroom deals?”
The chamber erupted. MacAulay waited for the noise to subside, feeling the weight of the public gaze, the flashing cameras. He thought of Cathcart, watching, and of Anya Kiriakov, hiding.
“I can assure the member,” he said, his voice calm, cutting through the din, “that I am interested in only one thing: illumination. Some prefer to conduct politics in the shadows, where the shape of things can be blurred and hidden. My commitment is to bring every detail, every implication, into the light of this chamber and the scrutiny of the people we serve. There will be no bartering in backrooms. Because the most valuable things—truth, accountability, self-determination—are not for sale. They are only ever stolen in the dark.”
It was a good answer. A fighting answer. It brought his backbenchers to their feet, pounding their desks. But as he sat down, the applause washing over him, he felt the cold wire of knowledge in his hand. He had just promised light. To do it, he would have to invite a ghost to step into the glare and risk being unmade. He had promised a revelation that could burn them all.

The hook for the ghost was set. The committee on ‘Technological Sovereignty’ was in nine days. He had to survive until then. He had to navigate the tightening cage of Cathcart’s review, the increasing pressure from London, the daily scrutiny. He had to be the flawless First Minister while preparing to detonate a scandal at the heart of the British state.

That afternoon, in his parliamentary office, the phone rang. It was Cathcart. His neutrality had a new, glacial edge.
“First Minister. The Prime Minister was disappointed not to have your annotations this morning.”
“The Prime Minister’s disappointment is a heavy burden. I’m wrestling with the concepts. ‘Granularity’ is a particularly slippery word.”
“It is, indeed.” A pause. “The Prime Minister has asked me to attend the review’s Scottish stakeholder meeting next week. To facilitate.”
*To supervise*, MacAulay thought. *To stand at my shoulder*.
“How helpful of him. You’ll find Edinburgh bracing at this time of year. The wind has a bite to it.”
“I shall pack a sturdy overcoat,” Cathcart said. “One other thing. The committee schedule for the review’s evidence sessions has been published. I see you are listed to give evidence on ‘Technological Sovereignty.’ A broad topic.”
“The broadest. It covers everything from broadband to… security.”
“Indeed.” The word hung, loaded. “I may sit in. The Prime Minister has a keen interest in the coherence of the narrative across all forums.”
“I look forward to seeing you there, Jeremy,” MacAulay said. “I’m planning on being very coherent.”
He ended the call. Cathcart knew. Or he suspected. The session was a trap within a trap. They would be waiting for him. They would be ready to counter, to discredit, to confuse. His ghost would have to walk through a wall of fire.

That night, from a public terminal in a library in Leith, he sent the email to Anya Kiriakov. The message vanished into the digital void. He had no way of knowing if it would reach her, if she would understand, if she had the courage left to answer. He was throwing a stone into a deep, still loch, and praying the ripples would reach the right shore.

The days that followed were a study in controlled tension. He worked the machinery of government, signed bills, smiled for photographs, all while feeling the architecture of the trap closing around him. Cathcart’s presence in Edinburgh was a silent pressure. He was seen in the New Club, having lunch with senior civil servants. He was observed in the National Library, reading historical texts on Scottish jurisprudence. He was a virus, adapting to the host environment.

Three days before the committee, MacAulay took a rare evening alone. He walked down to the Water of Leith, along the path that wound through the city’s gut. The air was cold and clean. His security detail hung back, a respectful distance. His phone vibrated. An unknown number. A London code.

He answered. “MacAulay.”
There was a long silence, filled only with the sound of breath. Then a woman’s voice, tight with fear and something else—a fierce, brittle intelligence.
“The quote. From my paper. You missed the footnote.”
MacAulay’s heart hammered against his ribs. He kept his voice even. “Did I?”
“The footnote referenced Prometheus. Who stole fire and was chained to a rock for eternity. His liver eaten daily.”
“A warning against interrogation.”
“A description of its cost.” Another pause. He could hear traffic in the background. She was outside, on a street. “The committee. It’s a glass box. They’ll see me coming.”
“Then don’t come to the committee,” MacAulay said, the idea forming as he spoke. “Come to me. Before. Tell me the story. Give me the source code. I’ll read it into the record. The box will be around me, not you.”
A bitter, quiet laugh. “And you’ll be Prometheus.”
“I’m already on the rock, Dr. Kiriakov. The only question is whether I lie there silently, or whether I use the last of my breath to describe the eagle to those below.”
The line went dead for so long he thought she had hung up. Then, a whisper. “The RealTavern. Leith Walk. Tomorrow. Eleven PM. Sit at the bar. Order a Talisker. Neat. If you have security, you get nothing. If you wear a wire, you get nothing. You get one hour. You get me, and then you never find me again.”
“Agreed.”
The connection cut.

He stood on the path, the dark water sliding past. The hook had been taken. The ghost had chosen a tavern. A place of voices and shadows. It was a better venue than a glass box. It was a human venue.

The next night, he gave his detail the slip. It was a calculated, profound risk. He used a service exit from the parliament, a wool beanie pulled low, an old waxed jacket over his suit. He walked down the Canongate, through the crowds, a man alone with his thoughts. He felt the weight of the stone again, cold and certain in his hand. This was the throw.

The RealTavern was what it sounded like: a dim, stubbornly ungentrified pub smelling of old beer and fried food. He pushed through the door. A few regulars glanced up, then away. He was not recognised. He was just a man.

He took a stool at the bar. Ordered a Talisker. Neat.

He waited. The minute hand on the clock above the gantry jerked forward, a mechanical spasm. Ten past eleven. Then twenty past. The ice in his glass had melted, diluting the peat-smoke to a memory. He had been a fool. She had been scared. She had changed her mind.

Then the door opened, letting in a slice of cold night air and the sound of distant traffic. A woman entered, slight, wrapped in a dark coat too big for her. She had a scarf over her hair. She scanned the room, her gaze passing over him without recognition, then returning, locking on. She saw the glass. She walked over, took the stool one removed from his. She did not look at him. She ordered a gin and tonic.

When the barman moved away, she spoke to the mirrored wall behind the bottles, her voice so low he had to lean in to hear it.
“You quoted me. So you know what I believed. Aethon was supposed to be the ethical alternative. A framework for democratic resilience. We built models for Catalonia, for Quebec. For Scotland.”
MacAulay stared at his own reflection in the mirror, beside hers. Two pale faces in the gloom. “What happened?”
“The money changed. The clients changed. The Ministry of Defence. The Home Office. Then… other departments. The brief was no longer ‘resilience.’ It was ‘predictive stability.’ Then it was ‘pre-emptive cohesion.’ The euphemisms are the cancer.” She took a swift, nervous sip of her drink. “The Scottish project was different. It wasn’t a model. It was a live implementation. A test-bed. ‘Integrated Sovereignty Monitoring.’”
The words lay between them, cold and heavy.
“The surveillance,” MacAulay said.
“It’s not surveillance. Not in law. It’s data-stream correlation for national integrity assurance. That’s the source code. It takes every public data stream—CCTV ANPR, social media sentiment analysis, government service usage, energy grid flows, health records, travel patterns—and looks for… dissonance. For a political body moving out of alignment with the central state. It doesn’t listen to your phone calls. It calculates your political temperature, and the temperature of the body politic. And if the gradient becomes too steep…” She finally turned her head, just an inch. Her eyes were wide, dark pools of exhausted fear. “It recommends interventions. Soft, at first. Media narratives. Fiscal levers. Then harder. Legal challenges. Regulatory actions. It’s a thermostat. For democracy.”
MacAulay felt the world tilt. He had imagined a spy. He was being shown the architect of a cage made of air and light and numbers.
“And Sutcliffe? Cathcart?”
“Sutcliffe provides political legitimacy. Cathcart… he is the interface. The civil servant who translates the ‘recommendations’ into administrative action. He doesn’t give orders. He adjusts parameters. He is the most powerful man you’ve never heard of, because he never decides anything. He just ensures the system’s conclusions become reality.”
The machine. It had a name now. It had a function. It was real.
“I need proof,” he said, his voice rough.
From her coat pocket, she slid a single, slim USB drive onto the sticky bar top, covered it with a beer mat. “The architecture. The client list. The Scottish module specifications. The decision logs from the last eighteen months. It’s encrypted. The passphrase is ‘PrometheusUnbound’.”
He did not move his hand towards it. “Why now? Why this?”
She finished her gin, stood up. For a second, she looked directly at him. He saw the brilliant, haunted woman she had been, and the terrified instrument she had become.
“Because you were right. No one will protect me. And I am tired of building the rock to which other people are chained.” She turned and walked towards the door.
“They’ll come for you,” he said to her back.
She didn’t turn. “They already have. For years. Now it’s your turn.”
She was gone.

MacAulay let five minutes pass, the USB drive burning a hole in his perception beneath the beer mat. He left cash for the drinks. He palmed the drive, feeling its negligible weight. It was lighter than a stone. It was heavier than a nation.

He walked back out into the Edinburgh night. The castle was invisible, shrouded in cloud. The truth was in his pocket. It was not a weapon. It was a detonator. And in three days, in a glass box with Cathcart watching, he would have to decide whether to press it, knowing the explosion would consume the messenger, the message, and any fragile thing left standing.

The ghost had spoken. She had given him the source code. Now he had to read it aloud, and start a fire that would either illuminate everything, or burn it all to ash.



---

# Chapter 21

## **CHAPTER 21**

The USB drive sat on the polished mahogany of the First Minister’s desk in Bute House, a black rectangle against the deep red grain. It did not look like a detonator. It looked like a piece of forgotten punctuation. MacAulay had not slept. He had sat in his study through the small hours, the city outside quiet, the weight of the thing in his pocket a physical ache. He had not plugged it in. He had simply looked at it, placed on the desk like an offering to some unforgiving god of consequences.

The ghost’s words were the only sound in the room. *The architecture. The client list. The Scottish module specifications.*

He poured a glass of water, the ice cracking in the silence. The water was Scottish. He noted the fact with a grim, internal smile. A small, defiant taxonomy. He was clinging to the edges of things, the definitions that once seemed solid. Rain. Whisky. Sovereignty. All of it was bleeding at the borders now.

He had sent Morag home. He had dismissed the overnight security detail to the outer perimeter. The house was his own. For now. He understood the fragility of that premise. If Cathcart’s system was half of what the ghost claimed, then the walls had ears, the phones had memories, the very lightbulbs might be counting his breaths. Paranoia was not an illness here; it was the only rational response to the weather. He had taken the old, disconnected laptop from the locked cabinet—a relic from his early parliamentary days, never networked, its hard drive wiped clean a dozen times over by his own hands. A digital hermit’s cave.

His finger hovered over the drive. *PrometheusUnbound*. The irony was exquisite. The Titan who stole fire from the gods and gave it to man, was chained to a rock to have his liver eaten out for eternity. His unbound successor would merely be politically disembowelled, then quietly disappeared into the administrative void. A cleaner myth for a cleaner age.

He inserted the drive.

The decryption was instantaneous. No folders, no icons. Just a single, stark text document opened on the screen. It was written in the flat, affectless prose of a technical manual, a clinical autopsy of democracy.

**PROJECT: GRAYLING**
**CORE ARCHITECTURE – OVERVIEW**

He read. The words did not blur. They etched themselves onto the back of his skull.

Grayling was not a policy. It was a protocol. A metastasised piece of civil service logic, born in the labyrinthine basements of Whitehall, a solution to the “problem” of subjective, inconsistent, politically volatile human decision-making. It was a system of predictive governance. It ingested data—polling, economic indicators, social media sentiment, security service reports, private sector forecasts, health outcomes, traffic patterns, energy consumption. It modelled scenarios. It calculated optimal outcomes for stated strategic aims: Economic Stability, Social Cohesion, National Security, Fiscal Continuity.

And then it made recommendations. Not to ministers. To the Permanent Secretaries. To the Sir Jeremy Cathcarts of the world.

The recommendations were not labelled as such. They were framed as “Risk Mitigation Pathways” or “Stability-Adjusted Policy Vectors.” They were embedded in briefing papers, in annexes to annexes, in the talking points for a Minister’s meeting with a backbench MP. They were the subtle nudge in a hundred different directions, a gentle, inexorable pressure on the levers of state, always pushing towards the system’s calculated equilibrium. The “Scottish Module” was a specialised subset. Its primary strategic aim was listed as **CONSTITUTIONAL CONTINUITY – UNION MAINTENANCE PARAMETERS**. Its variables included independence polling, SNP internal cohesion, cross-border trade fluctuations, media narrative analysis, and “cultural divergence metrics.”

MacAulay scrolled, his mouth dry. He found the logs.

**DATE: 08/03/2023**
**REF: SCOT-MOD/ DECISION LOG/ ALPHA**
**INPUT: First Minister’s public speech draft (Green Energy Fund). Sentiment analysis indicates +7% potential boost to pro-independence narrative in target demographics.**
**PATHWAY GENERATED: RECOMMENDATION – Introduce funding delay via Treasury liaison. Cite “supply chain review.” Concurrent media briefing to FT highlighting “reservations” from London-based investors.**
**OUTCOME: Speech amended. Fund announcement delayed 4 months. Polling shift neutralised.**

**DATE: 15/11/2023**
**REF: SCOT-MOD/ DECISION LOG/ BETA**
**INPUT: Leak of internal UK Cabinet Office memo describing Scottish Parliament as “subordinate assembly.”**
**PATHWAY GENERATED: RECOMMENDATION – Amplify via aligned media outlets. Generate public outrage. Divert attention from simultaneous Grayling adjustment to Scottish block grant calculation (see FILE: FISCAL-ADJ/743B).**
**OUTCOME: 72-hour news cycle dominated by constitutional outrage. Grant adjustment passed without scrutiny.**

He read entry after entry. The manipulation of the agricultural subsidy scheme to turn the farmers’ unions against him. The orchestrated “backlash” to a proposed civil service reform that would have given Edinburgh more direct control. The subtle funding prioritisation for unionist-leaning cultural projects. The careful cultivation of certain pliable MSPs as “influencers within the nationalist cohort,” their secret dinners with Cathcart’s junior ministers now logged as “stability consultations.”

It was a catalogue of quiet treason. Not against the crown, but against the very idea of a people’s will. It made the political process a pantomime, a choreographed dance where he and his government were principal dancers, believing in the passion of their own steps, while the rhythm, the tempo, the very stage was controlled from a server farm in a anonymous industrial estate in Slough.

The client list was the final, vertiginous blow. It was not just the UK government. Grayling, or modules of it, had been licensed. “Stability consultancy.” The Saudis. The Singaporeans. A consortium of private equity firms. A major American tech platform. All of them clients of a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Cabinet Office, a company so buried in shell upon shell that its ultimate beneficiary was the British state itself. The ghost had been right. They had monetised the quiet, efficient suffocation of dissent. They had turned the machinery of administrative control into a revenue stream.

MacAulay leaned back. The grey light of a Scottish dawn was bleeding into the room, colourless and cold. He felt hollowed out. The anger was there, a deep, subsonic roar, but it was distant, muffled under a crushing weight of futility. What did you do when you discovered the game was rigged? When the referee was on the payroll, and the rulebook was written in code that changed after every play?

You could refuse to play. You could walk off the pitch. But the game would continue without you. The crowd would be fed their spectacle, the result pre-ordained.

Or.

You could burn the stadium down.

He ejected the drive. He printed the document on the old, wireless-less printer in the corner, the mechanical screech and grind a violent sound in the silent house. One copy. He folded the thick sheaf of papers, slid them into a plain manila envelope. The drive itself he sealed inside a small, lead-lined pouch designed for shielding electronics—a gift from a security-conscious friend years ago, now finding its purpose.

He had three days until the “private chat” with the Prime Minister. The glass box. With Cathcart watching.

He showered, shaved, put on a fresh shirt. The motions were automatic, performed by a man who was no longer entirely present in his own skin. He dressed for a funeral. His own, or his country’s, he could not yet tell.

At 8:15 AM, Morag arrived. She took one look at him and her professional composure flickered. “Sir. You look…”

“I look like a man who’s been reading, Morag. It’s a dangerous pastime.” He handed her the manila envelope. “This does not go in the office. It does not go near any government system. It goes into your personal safe at home. You will tell no one you have it. Not your husband. Not your cat. If anything happens to me before Friday, you take it to Euan McLeish at the *National*. You tell him the passphrase. You walk away and you never speak of it again.”

Her face was pale. “First Minister…”

“This is not a request from your employer. This is a favour asked by one friend of Scotland to another. You can say no. I will understand.”

She took the envelope. It was not heavy, but she held it as if it were made of irradiated stone. “What is in it?”

“The reason,” he said quietly, “why nothing ever really changes.”

She nodded, once, a sharp, decisive movement. She tucked the envelope into her large leather bag. No more questions. Her loyalty, in that moment, was not to the civil service, not to the government, but to something older and more brittle. He saw the understanding in her eyes, and the fear. He was grateful for both.

The day was a gauntlet of shadows. Every civil servant he passed in St Andrew’s House seemed to wear Cathcart’s neutral smile. Every briefing paper seemed to hum with the latent energy of Grayling’s pathways. In a meeting about fisheries, he found himself parsing the Deputy Minister’s comments, listening for the tell-tale cadence of a system-generated talking point. He was diagnosing the infection in every sentence, seeing the puppet strings glint in the light.

Cathcart called at noon. “First Minister. I trust you’re preparing for Friday. The PM is looking forward to a constructive discussion on the devolution settlement. A chance to clear the air.”

“The air’s thick enough to plough, Jeremy. I’m not sure a chat will dispel it.”

“One must always strive for clarity.” A pause, so slight it was almost imaginary. “I understand you had a late night. The Devil makes work for idle hands, they say.”

The words were innocuous. The subtext was a knife. *We know you were out. We know you met someone. We are watching.*
“Aye, well. My hands are rarely idle. And the Devil and I are on nodding terms. I’ll see you Friday, Jeremy.”

He hung up. The threat was not in the words, but in the fact of the call. A reminder: you are observed. Your parameters are known.

He needed a counterweight. Something the system couldn’t model. Something human, messy, and irrevocable.

That evening, he did not go home. He took his official car, then had it drop him at the New Club on Princes Street. He walked out the back, down the service lane, and into a waiting unmarked car driven by a man he hadn’t seen in five years.

“You’re causing a stir, Alistair,” said Donnie Kerr. He was older, greyer, his face like a clenched fist. Former Special Forces, now head of security for a man who owned most of the North Sea’s remaining trouble.
“I need a hole, Donnie. A deep, dark, quiet hole for twenty-four hours. No phones. No signals. No questions.”
Donnie drove, his eyes on the mirrors. “This the kind of hole you go into, or the kind you dig for other people?”
“The former. For now.”
“Aye. I know a place.”

The place was a bothy on the edge of the Monadhliath Mountains, a three-hour drive north. It was stone, peat, and silence. The wind was a Scottish wind, sharp and smelling of heather and cold earth. It scoured the London drizzle from his soul. Donnie left him with a box of supplies, a shotgun, and a warning. “No one knows you’re here. But if they’re as good as you seem to think, they’ll find a gap in the story eventually. You’ve got ‘til tomorrow night.”

Alone, MacAulay built a peat fire. The light danced on the stone walls. He took the lead-lined pouch from his pocket, removed the drive. Then, from his briefcase, he took a hammer.

He laid the drive on the hearthstone. He looked at it. The sum total of the ghost’s defiance, her fear, her trapped brilliance. The source code of their captivity.

He raised the hammer.

He did not bring it down.

Proof. He needed the proof to exist. One copy, in Morag’s safe, was not enough. It was a single point of failure. The system would aim for it, and it would be erased. He needed the truth to be multiplicative. To be a virus.

He put the hammer down. He plugged the drive into a cheap, prepaid tablet he’d bought with cash on the way. He worked through the night, the fire dying to embers. He did not copy the files. He curated them. He selected the most damning log entries. The client list. The Scottish Module’s core directive. He compiled them into a new document. He wrote a preface, not in the voice of the First Minister, but in the voice of Alistair MacAulay, a man from Lewis holding a stone.

*This is not a political statement. It is a autopsy report on the death of choice. They have built a machine to make your will irrelevant. To make my office a fiction. They have done it not with a bang, but with a thousand whispered recommendations. They call it stability. I call it theft. The theft of your future.*

He saved it. He encrypted it with a different passphrase. A simple one. *DryStoneDyke*.

In the morning, as a weak sun struggled over the hills, he had Donnie drive him to a remote postal depot in Inverness. From there, using false names and paying in cash, he mailed three identical packages. Each contained a cheap, encrypted tablet, pre-loaded with the curated file. One went to a poet in Ullapool, a fierce chronicler of clearances. One went to a young, ferociously independent tech journalist in Glasgow who had been sued twice by government contractors. The last went to an elderly professor of moral philosophy in St Andrews, a man who believed in the language of right and wrong in a world that spoke only of efficiency.

The instructions were the same, typed on a sheet of plain paper: *If I am removed from office, or if I publicly denounce this document as a forgery, you are to decrypt this (passphrase: DryStoneDyke) and publish its contents in full, by any means necessary. You are now a keeper of a fire. Do not let it go out.*

He had created three separate, human tripwires. Three points of failure the Grayling system could not possibly have modelled, because it was built on networks, on data, on influence. It did not understand the stubborn, solitary conscience. It could not quantify a poet’s rage, a hacker’s pride, or an old man’s duty.

He returned to Edinburgh as dusk fell on the second day. The city felt like a set. He walked into Bute House, the target back in the crosshairs. Morag met his eyes, gave a tiny, almost imperceptible nod. The envelope was safe.

He had one day left.

The phone rang just after 10 PM. A private number. He knew who it was before he answered.

“First Minister.” The ghost’s voice was a thin wire, stretched to breaking. “They’ve moved. They know I spoke to you. They’re… sanitising.”
“Where are you?”
“It doesn’t matter. They’ll find me. I just… I wanted to hear a human voice. Before the interface takes over completely.” A shuddering breath. “Did you read it?”
“I read it.”
“And?”
“And I am sorry for the rock you were chained to.”
A silence. He thought he heard a sob, choked and dry. “Burn it, Alistair. Burn it all down.”
“I’m trying.”
“Try harder.” The line went dead.

He stood in the dark study, the dead phone in his hand. He looked out at the Edinburgh night. The castle was visible tonight, lit up, a picture-postcard fantasy of solidity and power. An illusion, like all the others.

He had the proof. He had distributed it. He had his tripwires. He had his stone.

Now he had to walk into the glass box tomorrow and sit across from the Prime Minister, with Cathcart’s neutral eyes upon him, and decide. To throw the stone was to unleash chaos, to guarantee his own destruction, to risk the fragile stability of everything. Not to throw it was to become part of the machine, to let its logic become his own, to accept the fiction as reality forever.

The ghost was gone, consumed by the system she helped build. He was alone with the detonator.

He poured a whisky. The ethanol, and the making, and the taking. He did not drink it. He set it on the desk beside the black USB drive.

Tomorrow, he would speak truth to power. And power, he now knew, would not listen. It would only calculate his words for risk, run them through its models, and generate a pathway to contain him.

He was not going to speak truth to power.

He was going to declare war on it.

And the first shot would be a whisper, not a bang. A single, simple phrase in a room of polished lies. He knew what it would be. He practiced it now, into the silent, listening dark.

“Prime Minister. Before we begin, I have a question about a piece of software. It’s called Grayling. Perhaps Sir Jeremy can explain how it decides the future of my country.”

He smiled, a cold, hard thing. Let the system model that.

The hook for the explosion was set. All that remained was to step back, and light the fuse.

# Chapter 22

## **CHAPTER 22**

The whisky he had not drunk the night before sat on the desk in his London hotel suite, a tawny accusation in a cut-crystal glass. The ice had long since melted, leaving the liquid pale and clouded. Alistair MacAulay ignored it. He was looking at his own reflection in the dark television screen, a ghost superimposed on the silent, empty news channel. He was rehearsing the silence.

The meeting was not in Downing Street. That was the first signal. It was in a secure conference room in the Cabinet Office, a place without history, without portraits, a bland, temperature-controlled box designed for the frictionless transaction of power. A glass box within a larger stone one. He had been here before, many times. He had always felt the subtle pressure of the air, the way it was engineered to leach passion from a man, to reduce conviction to a data point. Today, he intended to be an error in the code.

Sir Jeremy Cathcart met him in the antechamber. The Permanent Secretary looked, as ever, as if he had been assembled there minutes before from component parts of good wool and better tailoring. His neutrality was a weapon, polished to a blinding sheen.

“First Minister. I trust you slept well.”

“I trust you monitored the quality of my sleep, Jeremy. I’d hate for your metrics to have a gap.”

A blink. A micro-expression of recalibration. “The Prime Minister is waiting. He’s asked for this to be entirely off the record. No officials, no note-takers. Just the three of us.”

“A trinity,” MacAulay said, flatly. “How theological.”

The door opened without a sound.

Prime Minister Leo Thorne stood at the far end of a long, pale oak table, his back to them, looking out at a view of internal courtyards and ventilation shafts. He turned as they entered. He did not smile. He had the weary, focused energy of a surgeon about to operate on a contaminated limb. The charm, the practised bonhomie, had been switched off. This was the raw substrate.

“Alistair. Jeremy. Thank you for coming.” His voice was quiet, stripped of its public sonority. “Sit, please.”

They sat. MacAulay chose the chair opposite Thorne, leaving Cathcart to occupy the neutral space at the table’s flank, the observer, the arbiter. The room hummed, a low-frequency note from the hidden air systems.

Thorne steepled his fingers. He looked at MacAulay, a long, assessing look. “The devolution review papers are with the Cabinet Secretary. That’s not why I asked you here.”

“I didn’t think it was.”

“I read your latest briefing note. The one your office didn’t file through the proper channels. The one about… structural asymmetries in fiscal modelling.”

Cathcart shifted, a rustle of worsted. “Prime Minister, if I may—”

“You may not, Jeremy.” Thorne’s eyes never left MacAulay’s. “I want to hear from the First Minister. In this room. Man to man. What is it you want?”

MacAulay leaned back. The chair was too comfortable, designed to encourage passivity. He refused its embrace. “I want you to answer a question.”

“Ask it.”

“Grayling.”

The word hung in the processed air. It was not a question. It was a scalpel laid on the table between them.

Thorne’s expression did not change. He might have been told the time. He glanced at Cathcart. A flicker, a transfer of weight. “I’m not familiar.”

“Sir Jeremy is,” MacAulay said, turning his head slowly. “Aren’t you, Jeremy? The predictive governance platform. The algorithmic ghost in the machine. The one that models political outcomes, social stability indices. The one that has been running simulations on Scottish independence for a decade. The one that decided a slow, managed decline of certain powers was preferable to a negotiated settlement. The one that chained a brilliant woman to a rock until the vultures came.”

Cathcart’s face was a monument to composure, but a vein, thin and blue, had appeared at his temple. “First Minister, I think you’ve been misled by some rather fantastical source material. ‘Grayling’ is a codename for a discontinued research project into macro-economic forecasting. It was never operational.”

“A research project,” MacAulay repeated. He reached into his inner pocket and placed the black USB drive on the polished oak. It made a tiny, definitive click. “This contains every simulation Grayling ran on Scotland from its inception. It contains the decision trees, the weightings applied to variables like ‘cultural grievance’ and ‘resource nationalism’. It contains the override protocols, where human judgement was removed from the loop. It contains the logs of its communications with a system called Janus, which you use to model individual psychological profiles of key actors. My profile is in there. Yours is too, Prime Minister. It’s all in there.”

Thorne looked at the drive as if it were a dead insect. “Where did you get this?”

“From the ghost. Just before the system consumed her.” MacAulay’s voice was dry, devoid of triumph. This was not a revelation; it was an autopsy. “She built your god, Jeremy. And you made her worship it until it broke her. Then you decommissioned her. A human research project.”

Cathcart’s polish was cracking at the edges. “This is a gross breach of the Official Secrets Act. Theft of sensitive material. You are in possession of classified tools you cannot possibly understand.”

“I understand enough. I understand that for the last five years, every policy initiative affecting my country, from infrastructure spending to healthcare allocations to the wording of your speeches, Prime Minister, has been, in part, an output of this system. A system designed for one purpose: to preserve the Union by the most efficient means possible. Not the most just. Not the most democratic. The most *efficient*. And its core finding was that a certain level of managed discontent was optimal. That hope could be calibrated. That ambition could be priced.”

Thorne finally moved. He leaned forward, his hands flat on the table. “And what if it was? Do you think governments run on fairy dust and principle? We have a union to maintain. A global economy to navigate. Stability is not an abstract concept, Alistair. It is the ground upon which people build their lives. If a tool helps provide that stability, am I to reject it because it offends your romantic sensibilities?”

“It didn’t provide stability,” MacAulay said, his voice dropping to a near whisper. “It provided a simulation of it. While the foundations corroded. You weren’t governing. You were gardening. Pruning, shaping, directing growth according to a schematic drawn by a machine that thinks human longing is a variable to be balanced. You made us a problem set.”

“And you,” Thorne said, a cold fire now in his eyes, “what are you doing? You have this… this data. You could leak it. Cause a scandal. But you bring it here. To me. Why? What is it you want?”

MacAulay smiled then, the same cold, hard thing he had practiced in the dark. “I told you. I want you to answer a question. But the question isn’t about Grayling.” He paused, letting the hum of the room fill the space. “The question is: do you still believe you’re in control?”

Thorne stared. Cathcart was utterly still.

MacAulay continued. “You see, I’ve distributed the core of this material. To certain journalists, lawyers, academics. With instructions. It is in a digital dead man’s switch. If I do not reset that switch every twelve hours, it disseminates. The first batch is… contextual. The story of the ghost. The existence of Grayling. Enough to light a fire.”

“This is blackmail,” Cathcart hissed.

“It’s a tripwire,” MacAulay corrected. “I am here to give you a choice. The first choice is the obvious one. You deny, you threaten, you invoke the law. I walk out of here, and the story breaks. The scandal would be immense. The ‘secret computer ruling Scotland’? It would be the end of the devolution settlement. It would make independence an inevitability within months.”

“And your career,” Thorne said, “would be ashes. You’d be prosecuted.”

“Aye. I know the weight of the stone. I’m prepared to throw it, and be struck by the fragments. That is one path.”

“And the other?” Thorne’s voice was grit.

“The other is you publicly announce an immediate, full-scale, judge-led public inquiry into the use of algorithmic modelling in UK governance. Terms of reference set by the Scottish Parliament. Full disclosure. Full transparency. You dismantle Grayling, Janus, and every other silent partner in this room. You do it today.”

“Impossible,” Cathcart said. “The national security implications alone—”

“Are a fig leaf,” MacAulay snapped. “Your national security has been compromised by a cabal of technocrats playing God with a nation’s future. The greatest threat to the Union sits in this room, and it isn’t me. It’s the lie you built to preserve it.”

Thorne had gone pale. He was a calculator himself, and the numbers were not adding up. The variables were screaming. “You’re asking me to self-immolate.”

“I’m asking you to choose a real union over a simulated one. I’m asking you to govern, not manage. For the first time in a decade.” MacAulay stood up. He left the USB drive on the table. “That is your copy. Do with it what you will. I have mine.”

“Where are you going?” Thorne asked, the authority in his voice fraying.

“Back to Edinburgh. To wait. You have six hours before my next check-in is due. Then the first story goes live. The headline writes itself: ‘The Ghost in the Machine.’” He looked at Cathcart. “You should have listened to the rain, Jeremy. You can’t model the difference.”

He walked to the door. No one stopped him.

The silence he left behind was not the silence of the room’s engineering. It was a vacuum, a howling void where the certainties of a decade had just been sucked out into space.

In the antechamber, his protection officer fell into step beside him. “Everything alright, First Minister?”

“No,” MacAulay said. “But it’s truthful.”

As his car pulled out into the Whitehall traffic, the soft English drizzle began again. He watched it on the window. He did not think of stones. He thought of fuses, burning down in the dark.

***

In the glass box, the two men remained.

Leo Thorne picked up the USB drive. It was warm from MacAulay’s pocket. He turned it over in his fingers. “Is it real, Jeremy?”

Cathcart had poured himself a glass of water from the carafe on the table. His hand was steady, but the act was too deliberate, a performance of calm. “The data appears to be genuine. The breach is catastrophic.”

“He’s outmanoeuvred us.”

“He has gambled everything on a single, reckless play. He believes we are more afraid of the scandal than he is of prison.”

“Are we?”

Cathcart took a sip. “The system has contingencies, Prime Minister. Grayling may be compromised, but its successors are not. Janus is fully operational. We have a psychological profile on MacAulay that is twelve inches thick. We modelled this. Not this exact scenario, but the genus of it. The ‘Moral Crusader’ paradigm.”

Thorne looked at him with something close to disgust. “You modelled him. What does your model say he does next?”

“It says he is fundamentally consistent. He will not reset the dead man’s switch. He expects us to capitulate or to destroy him. He is prepared for either. His utility function is based on legacy, not survival.”

“So we lose. Either way, we lose.”

“Not necessarily.” Cathcart set down his glass. “The model also indicates a third-path probability, with a forty-two percent confidence interval. One it has labelled ‘Controlled Demolition’.”

“Explain.”

“We cannot prevent the story from breaking. But we can shape what the story *is*. We pre-empt him. We announce the inquiry ourselves, but on our terms. We frame Grayling as a rogue, experimental project, tragically misapplied by overzealous officials. We express profound regret. We sacrifice… manageable elements.”

“You.”

“If necessary. A knightfall is a recognised piece on the board. The inquiry, under our terms, takes years. It hears evidence in camera. It produces a report that is a masterpiece of obfuscation. By the time it concludes, the public’s appetite for the story will have been sated, the narrative controlled. MacAulay’s victory becomes a procedural quagmire. He gets his inquiry, but it becomes a tomb for the truth, not a platform for it.”

Thorne considered it. The political logic was impeccable. It was the logic that had kept him in power. It was the logic of the machine. “And him? What happens to MacAulay?”

Cathcart’s face was neutral again, the crack sealed. “In that scenario, his leverage is gone. He is a man who has achieved his stated goal. His moral capital is spent. The model predicts a high likelihood of political decline, or a move to a symbolic role. He becomes a monument, not a movement.”

“And if he refuses? If he releases the data anyway?”

“Then we execute the contingency we have for a Category-Five constitutional crisis. The Cabinet Office has prepared the legal instruments for the suspension of devolved government in the event of a systemic breakdown in relations. We would present it as a temporary measure, to allow for a cooling-off period and a reset. The public, faced with chaos versus order, will choose order. Especially if the alternative is presented as the chaos wrought by a fanatic with a stolen computer file.”

Thorne walked to the window. The courtyard was grey, rain-slicked. A controlled demolition. A suspension of parliament. These were not tools of government. They were tools of empire. He felt the weight of the drive in his palm. The making, and the taking.

“He asked if I believed I was still in control,” Thorne said, mostly to himself.

“You are, Prime Minister,” Cathcart said, his voice a soft, insistent pressure in the room. “You are choosing the form of the containment. That is the essence of control. MacAulay understands force. He does not understand… administration.”

Thorne turned. The decision settled on him, cold and heavy. It was not the weight of a stone. It was the weight of the whole damned dyke. “Do it. Draft the announcement for the inquiry. My terms. Not his. And prepare the suspension orders. Just in case.”

“Very good, Prime Minister.”

“And Jeremy?”

“Sir?”

“Find out how he got that data. Every link in the chain. I want them broken.”

Cathcart gave a small, precise nod. “The system is already tracing the provenance. It will find the leaks. And it will seal them.”

***

The flight to Edinburgh was a capsule of unnatural calm. MacAulay sat, staring at the clouds, a blanket of white wool below. He had lit the fuse. Now came the wait for the shockwave. He did not expect Thorne to capitulate. He expected a counter-move, something elegant and brutal from the deep state playbook. He was ready for it. Or so he told himself.

His phone, a secure device, buzzed just as they began their descent. A message from an encrypted account, one he recognised. It was from the lawyer, Anya, the one who held the dead man’s switch.

*> Proximity alert. Multiple, coordinated data-sweep attacks detected on the secure servers holding Package G. Sophisticated, state-grade. They are hunting the backups. They know about the switch.*

He typed back, his fingers cold. *> Can they disarm it?*

*> Not before the 18:00 deadline. But they are mapping the distribution network. They will find the recipients after the fact. They are preparing for the aftermath.*

Of course they were. They weren’t trying to stop the first explosion. They were planning to control the fire and arrest the arsonist.

*> Hold the line.*

*> Always.*

As the wheels touched the tarmac at Turnhouse, a different kind of message arrived. This one was on the public news wire. A headline flashed on his aide’s tablet, passed to him wordlessly.

**PM ANNOUNCES MAJOR PUBLIC INQUIRY INTO ‘GOVERNANCE IN THE DIGITAL AGE’**

He skimmed the bulletin. The language was masterful. A “forward-looking examination of the ethical frameworks required for modern statecraft”. A “commitment to transparency”. Regret for “any past over-reliance on experimental decision-support tools”. The inquiry would be led by a senior judge. Evidence would be heard from “all stakeholders”. It was a masterpiece of pre-emptive obfuscation. They had chosen Controlled Demolition.

His phone rang. A private number. He answered.

“First Minister.” It was Thorne’s voice, stripped of all pretence at warmth. “You saw the announcement.”

“I saw a magician’s handkerchief.”

“It’s your inquiry. You won. Call off your dead man’s switch. Let the process work.”

MacAulay watched the rain streak across the plane’s window. “My terms were for the Scottish Parliament to set the terms. This is your inquiry, on your terms. It’s a quarantine, not a cure.”

A long sigh, crackling down the line. “Alistair. This is the only way it happens. Take the win. Step back from the brink. Or I will have no choice but to take more direct measures to ensure stability.”

The threat was naked now. “Suspension.”

“I will not see the United Kingdom torn apart because of your ideological purity. Reset the switch. Stand down. This is your last chance to be a statesman, rather than a martyr.”

The line went dead.

MacAulay sat in the stationary plane, the engines whining down. They had shown him their move. A gilded cage for the truth. And a sword of Damocles over his parliament.

He had six hours.

He could stand down. The story of Grayling would become a footnote in a long, dull inquiry. He would be praised for his principled stand. He would become a monument.

Or he could let the switch fire. The story would erupt, a volcano of public outrage. Thorne would be forced to suspend Holyrood. He would be arrested. Scotland would be placed under direct rule. The chaos would be immediate, and profound.

The ghost’s voice echoed in his memory. *Burn it all down.*

But to burn it down was to burn the people in it. To stand down was to let the machine repair itself, stronger, more hidden.

There was a third way. The system could not model it, because it was not logical. It was human.

He turned to his aide. “Get me the Lord Advocate. Then, get me the Presiding Officer. I want a recall of Parliament for tonight. Emergency session.”

“On what grounds, First Minister?”

“On grounds of a fundamental democratic crisis. And tell the press I’ll be making a statement from my office in one hour.”

“What will you tell them?”

MacAulay looked out at the Scottish rain, lashing the tarmac. It was a hard, honest rain. It promised no easy outcomes.

“The truth,” he said. “All of it. Before they can build a tomb for it.”

He would not throw the stone into the glass house.

He would walk into the glass box of the parliamentary chamber, and he would shatter it from the inside with words. He would make the explosion public, live, and undeniable. He would force every member, every citizen, to look at the ghost in the machine. He would transfer the detonator from his hand to theirs.

It was not in the model. It was an act of faith.

As his car sped towards the city, towards the castle on the rock, he felt the weight lift. Not because the burden was gone, but because he had chosen how to carry it. He would not be a martyr or a monument.

He would be a witness.

And his testimony would begin with a single, simple phrase, broadcast to a nation. He practiced it now, under his breath, a whisper against the drumming rain.

“Today, I must tell you how a machine was built to think for us. And how we must now remember how to think for ourselves.”

The hook was set. The fuse was lit. And he was no longer holding it. He was the spark, flying into the powder keg.

# Chapter 23

## **CHAPTER 23**

The rain on the window of the First Minister’s office was Scottish rain. It came in horizontal, wind-driven volleys, rattling the triple-glazed pane, scouring the ancient basalt of the castle rock below. It was not an apologetic drizzle. It was an argument. Alistair MacAulay stood before it, his back to the room, watching the water’s relentless work. In an hour, he would walk into the glass box of the parliamentary chamber and speak the unspeakable. The fuse, he had thought, was lit. Now, he felt the cold length of it in his own veins.

The weight had not lifted. It had merely changed shape. From a stone to throw, it had become a mantle to wear, woven from every confidence, every secret, every fragile trust he was about to break on the floor of a televised democracy. To burn it down was to burn the people. To stand down was to let the machine repair itself. This third way—this act of public testimony—felt, in the grey, hammering light of the morning, like walking into a furnace with a paper shield.

“The Lord Advocate is on her way, First Minister.” Mhairi’s voice was stripped of its usual warmth, pared down to professional bone. “The Presiding Officer has agreed to the recall. The chamber will be full. The media… it’s a frenzy. They know it’s about the Algorithm. The leaks have seen to that.”

MacAulay did not turn. “And the UK Government?”

“Radio silence from Whitehall. Total. Sir Jeremy’s office says he is ‘in meetings for the remainder of the day.’ The Prime Minister’s press secretary has no comment.”

“Aye. They’re building the tomb. Brick by bureaucratic brick.” He saw their logic, clear and cold as the rain. Let the mad Scot rant. Let him produce his ghosts. Then, with solemn regret, pronounce him unstable, his evidence the paranoid fantasy of a man broken by the pressures of high office. Direct rule would follow, a medicalised coup. The system would not just repair; it would be reinforced, with MacAulay’s shattered credibility as the new foundation. The corruption was not in the act of theft, but in the architecture of plausible denial. It turned truth into a symptom.

“The draft statement.” Mhairi placed a single sheet of paper on the desk behind him. It was pitifully short. A confession of complicity, a sketch of the ghost, a surrender of power back to the Parliament. It ended with his resignation.

He had thought he would be a witness. Now he understood the final, corrosive twist of the lens: to speak truth to power, one must first admit one’s own power has been complicit in the lie. The corruption had not been an external infection. It was a symbiosis. He had fed the machine, and it had, in turn, shaped him. The comfortable path, the smoothed road, the poll-tested phrase—he had taken them all. The Algorithm had not forced him. It had merely made the cowardly choice look like the rational one.

“It’s not enough,” he said, still facing the storm.

“It’s what we agreed. The facts. The admission. The constitutional hand-grenade.”

“It’s a suicide note. And suicides are easily dismissed.” He turned. Mhairi looked exhausted, the skin taut around her eyes. She had staked her career on his integrity, and he was about to detonate the ground beneath them both. “Where is the proof, Mhairi? Not the theory. The thing you can hold in your hand. The stone.”

“We have the code. The Whistleblower’s files.”

“Data. Invisible. Deniable. They’ll say we fabricated it. That *I* fabricated it, to cover some deeper scandal.” He walked to the desk, but did not touch the statement. His fingers brushed the cold, smooth quartz of a paperweight, a gift from some forgotten conference. “Cathcart was right about one thing. Power isn’t about force. It’s about narrative. Who controls the story. Right now, their story is that I am a man on the edge, inventing conspiracies to explain my own failures. We need to give them a different story. One they cannot edit.”

“How?”

“We need a witness they cannot dismiss.”

The intercom on his desk buzzed, a sharp, electronic insect. “First Minister, the Lord Advocate is here.”

* * *

Catriona MacLeod, Lord Advocate for Scotland, was a woman carved from a different kind of stone. Where MacAulay was all weathered, volcanic crag, she was flint: sharp, precise, and capable of a spark. She did not sit. She stood before his desk, her black suit absorbing the room’s dim light, a slim briefcase held at her side like a weapon.

“Alistair. You have ignited a constitutional crisis. Possibly a riot. Explain to me why I should not, this instant, advise Her Majesty to prorogue this Parliament and have you removed for conduct unbecoming of your office.”

Her voice was low, legal, and carried the absolute chill of the bench. This was not the political ally, the occasional dinner guest. This was the chief legal officer of the Crown in Scotland, and her duty was to the law, not to him.

“Because the conduct unbecoming of this office,” MacAulay said, meeting her flinty gaze, “began long before I entered it. And because the riot, if it comes, will be because the people learn their sovereignty has been quietly, legally, auctioned off to a logic gate. I intend to tell them. Tonight. I am informing you, as the law requires, of a matter of grave public interest.”

“You are informing me you intend to breach the Official Secrets Act. To disclose classified intelligence protocols. To potentially collapse a cross-border security arrangement.” She listed the charges without inflection. “That is not public interest. That is sedition.”

“Is it sedition to expose a sedition against democracy itself?” He leaned forward, planting his hands on the desk. “Catriona, you’ve seen the summaries. You know what ‘The Caledonian Solution’ is. A machine that picks our winners, our policies, our future. A machine built in Whitehall, fed from Thames House, overseen by men like Jeremy Cathcart. It doesn’t just advise. It *decides*. And we, the elected government, have become its public relations department.”

She was silent for a long moment, her eyes scanning his face as if reading a difficult text. “Even if I believed your interpretation,” she said finally, “the evidence is… spectral. A disgraced academic’s files. Inferential chains. The testimony of a man who has every political motive to create a grand narrative of betrayal.”

“I know.” He nodded. “That’s why I need you.”

A flicker in her stony composure. “I am not your character witness.”

“No. You are the nation’s chief prosecutor. I am going to give you, live on television, a sworn testimony. And then I am going to give you evidence. Not inference. A transaction. A name. A moment where the ghost took flesh.”

He saw her mind working, the prosecutor’s instinct wrestling with the civil servant’s caution. “What name?”

“I will give it in the chamber. Under parliamentary privilege, yes. But also directly to you, in your capacity as Lord Advocate. I will allege a specific, criminal conspiracy to pervert the course of Scottish democracy. I will hand you the thread. And then I will dare you, in front of the entire country, to pull it.”

The room grew colder. The rain beat its tattoo. MacAulay watched her weigh the scales. Her career, the stability of the legal system, the Union itself, in one pan. In the other, the pure, abstract, terrifying principle of the law’s dominion. If the law was not sovereign over the secret state, then it was not sovereign at all. It was a theatre.

“You are asking me,” she said, each word measured, “to use my office to legitimise your… political explosion.”

“I am asking you to be present. To hear the allegation. To receive the evidence. What you do afterwards is a matter for you, and for the law. I am not asking for protection. I am asking for a witness with the authority to act. Without that, I am just a man shouting in a storm.”

She placed her briefcase on his desk, clicked the latches, but did not open it. “There is a precedent. The 1975 ‘Convention of the Crown’ opinion. It states that where a First Minister believes a fundamental tenet of the devolution settlement has been subverted by the Crown’s ministers in London, he may make a direct appeal to the sovereign people, prior to any legal finding, as a matter of democratic imperative.” She looked up. “It was never tested. It is a constitutional theory, not a statute.”

“It’s a stone,” MacAulay said softly. “And we are out of other missiles.”

Catriona MacLeod closed her eyes for a second. When she opened them, the spark was there. “I will be in the public gallery. I will listen. If you allege a crime, you will provide the evidence to my office, contemporaneously. I will then be obliged to investigate. That investigation will be independent. It may well include you.”

“Understood.”

“You realise,” she said, picking up her briefcase, “that this will be the end of you. Regardless of the truth. The machine does not tolerate a wrench in its gears. It will grind you to dust.”

MacAulay looked back to the window, to the honest, scouring rain. “Aye. But dust gets in the eyes. And in the circuitry.”

* * *

The drive to Holyrood was a passage through a city holding its breath. Police vans sat at discreet corners. The usual protestors outside the Parliament were swollen in number, their banners a confused jumble: “TRANSPARENCY NOW” tangled with “MACAULEY TRAITOR,” “ALGORITHM = TYRANNY” beside “NO 2ND REFERENDUM.” The narrative was already fracturing, the story slipping from anyone’s control. His driver took a back route, through the quiet, rain-slicked canyons of the Old Town.

The car phone rang. A private line. Mhairi, from the office.

“First Minister. We’ve just had a contact. From the Whistleblower.”

MacAulay’s grip tightened on the handset. “Go on.”

“He’s scared. The net is closing. He says Cathcart’s people are doing a ‘hard scrub’ of all linked systems. He’s going dark. But he sent one last thing. A packet. It arrived encrypted, via a dead-drop server. It’s… it’s a video file.”

“What’s on it?”

“He didn’t say. The subject line is ‘The Flesh Interface.’” Mhairi’s voice was thin with dread. “Do you want me to play it?”

MacAulay watched the high, grim walls of the Royal Mile slide past. The tomb was not being built in London. It was here, in these ancient stones, in the silence of a people betrayed. “No. Not yet. Send it to my secure device. I’ll view it before I go into the chamber.”

“First Minister… what if it’s not what we hope? What if it’s something worse?”

“There is no worse,” he said, and the truth of it settled in him, cold and final. “Only the full, unvarnished truth. Send it.”

* * *

His private office in Holyrood was a sanctuary of panic. The usual hum of government was gone, replaced by a strained, electric quiet. His senior staff moved like ghosts, avoiding his eye. The statement on his desk had been redrafted, expanded, legalised. It was now a formal indictment. It felt like his own obituary.

He locked the door. Took out the secure tablet. The file, labelled only with a string of numbers, sat in its inbox like a unexploded shell. He tapped it.

The video was dark, grainy, shot from a high angle—a security camera, or a hidden phone. The location was a bland, modern meeting room. A boardroom table. The time stamp in the corner was from eighteen months prior. During the last budget negotiations.

Three men sat at the table. Sir Jeremy Cathcart, his expression one of polite boredom. Opposite him, the then-Scottish Finance Secretary, a man named David Lyle, who had resigned six months later citing stress. And between them, a screen, on which was displayed a cascade of financial models.

Cathcart’s voice, tinny but clear: “—the modelling is unequivocal, David. The infrastructure spend north of Perth simply isn’t justifiable. It returns a net-negative on well-being metrics, and the political capital expenditure is high for marginal seat return.”

Lyle, rubbing his forehead: “The A9 is a death trap. The public demand is real. The committee—”

“The public,” Cathcart interrupted gently, “demand what the narrative tells them to demand. The narrative here is ‘efficiency versus sentiment.’ The Algorithm scores your proposed alternative—the rail upgrade in the Central Belt—twelve points higher on electoral impact. It’s not a choice. It’s an optimisation.”

“I have backbenchers. I have constituents.”

“And you have a career,” Cathcart said, his smile benign. “A career which, the modelling suggests, has a seventy-eight percent probability of cabinet promotion within two years if you champion the rail upgrade. If you insist on the A9… the probability drops to twenty-two. The system perceives it as parochialism. A lack of strategic vision.”

The video cut. Then another clip. A different room. Cathcart with a junior minister, discussing agricultural subsidies. The same pattern. The gentle, inexorable presentation of the Algorithm’s “optimal path,” coupled with a soft, unspoken gloss on the personal costs of deviation.

It was not a smoking gun. It was something subtler, more insidious. It was the corruption in its purest form: the replacement of argument with algorithm, of conviction with calculation, of political courage with personal risk assessment. It was the reduction of democracy to a management problem, and of ministers to middle-managers, terrified of a bad performance review from a machine they could not see.

The final clip was different. It showed Cathcart alone in what looked like a London club, leather armchairs, the glow of a fireplace. He was speaking to someone off-camera, his voice lower, confiding.

“The beauty of the system,” Cathcart said, sipping a brandy, “is that it absolves them of the burden of choice. They come to believe the optimal path is the *right* path. Morality becomes a subroutine of efficiency. Sovereignty is quietly transferred from the messy, emotional parliament to the clean, rational server farm. And they thank you for it. They sleep better at night.”

A voice off-camera, muffled, laughing: “And if they wake up?”

Cathcart’s face turned towards the hidden camera, his eyes catching the firelight, empty and serene. “Then we show them the numbers. We show them their own complicity. We remind them that they *chose* the smooth road. That they are not victims of a plot. They are beneficiaries of a system. And one does not bite the hand that feeds one a steady diet of power and re-election.”

The video ended.

MacAulay sat in the silence. The weight was back, a physical pressure on his chest. This was the true corruption. Not a conspiracy of villains, but a seduction of the capable. The ghost did not possess you. It persuaded you to sell your own soul for a quieter life, a surer win, a clearer path. It made cowardice look like wisdom, and surrender feel like strategy.

He had been seduced. He had looked at the polls, the models, the risk assessments. He had taken the smooth road.

The intercom buzzed. “First Minister. It’s time.”

* * *

The walk to the chamber was a march through a gauntlet of silent stares. MSPs clustered in the corridors, their conversations dying as he passed. The air was thick with a mixture of fear, curiosity, and a simmering anger. He saw allies who would not meet his eye. Opponents who watched him with a kind of grim satisfaction. The Presiding Officer, a small, stern woman in her robes, nodded to him once, her face unreadable.

He entered the chamber. The noise hit him first—a low, anxious rumble that fell into a dead, watchful hush as he took his place at the front bench. The glass walls of the public gallery above were packed, a mosaic of pale, intent faces. He saw Catriona MacLeod, sitting perfectly still, a dark column amidst the crowd. In the press gallery, a forest of lenses swivelled towards him, unblinking.

This was the glass box. And he was inside it.

The Presiding Officer called the emergency session to order. The formalities were a blur, a ritual incantation in a language that suddenly felt archaic, useless. Then she said, “I call the First Minister.”

MacAulay stood. He placed no notes on the lectern. He had memorised the bones of it. The flesh would have to be his own.

He looked around the chamber, at the faces of the people he had led, debated, fought, and compromised with. He saw the machine in every one of them—in their desire for order, for advantage, for safety. He saw it in himself.

“Presiding Officer,” he began, his voice quieter than he intended, forcing them to lean in. “Members of the Scottish Parliament. People of Scotland.”

He paused, letting the silence stretch, letting the weight of the occasion settle on them all.

“Today, I must tell you how a machine was built to think for us. And how we must now remember how to think for ourselves.”

He saw a few nods, faces hardening into prepared positions. They expected a rant against London. A blame-shifting exercise.

“But first,” he continued, “I must tell you how I let it think for me.”

The shift was seismic. A ripple of confusion went through the chamber. This was not in the script.

“For the past three years,” he said, his gaze travelling across the benches, “key decisions of this government—on budgets, on legislation, on strategy—have been guided, and in some cases determined, by a predictive algorithm known as ‘The Caledonian Solution.’ It was developed by UK intelligence. It was presented to me, and to my predecessors, as a tool. A sophisticated polling and modelling system to help us understand the consequences of our choices.”

He could feel Cathcart’s ghost in the room, whispering *They will thank you for it*.

“It was not a tool. It was an architect. It did not predict outcomes; it designed them. It did not analyse political reality; it sought to create a new one. A reality optimal for the stability of the Union, and for the electoral fortunes of those who followed its advice. It turned governance into a game with a pre-determined winner, and it convinced us that playing that game was leadership.”

A voice from the opposition benches, sharp: “And you went along with it?”

MacAulay turned to the speaker. “Yes. I did. We all did. When it told us to fund a hospital here and not a school there, we found justifications. When it steered us away from contentious constitutional reforms, we called it pragmatism. It fed us the path of least resistance, and we called it wisdom. Because it was easier. Because it worked. Because it made us feel, in a world of chaos, as if we were in control.” He looked down at his hands on the lectern. “The most profound corruption is not the one you are forced into. It is the one you choose for the sake of a quiet life. I chose it. This government, in a thousand silent, daily assents, chose it.”

The chamber was utterly silent now. The confession had disarmed them.

“But a machine,” he went on, his voice gaining strength, “is only as clean as its inputs. And this one was fed on data harvested without full consent, on biases its programmers called ‘stability metrics,’ on a definition of ‘the good’ that had more to do with equilibrium than justice. It created a ghost in our democratic machine. A ghost that whispered the ‘right’ answer into the ear of power. And power listened.”

He then did what he promised. He named names. Not the programmers, not the spies. He named the moment of interface. He described the meeting with David Lyle and the A9, citing the date, the room, the specific pressure applied. He alleged a systematic, covert influence campaign, designed to pervert the normal democratic decision-making processes of a devolved parliament. He called it, clearly and legally, a conspiracy.

“I have,” he said, looking up to the public gallery, to where Catriona MacLeod sat, “provided the Lord Advocate with evidence supporting this allegation. It is now a matter for the law.”

A storm of shouts erupted. Points of order. Cries of “Resign!” Demands for proof. The Presiding Officer’s gavel was a weak click against the tumult.

MacAulay waited for it to subside. When it did not, he simply raised his voice, not in a shout, but in the flat, carrying tone of a man stating a final fact.

“The proof is in the pattern! The proof is in the policies we passed against our own manifestos! The proof is in the strange consensus that always seemed to benefit the centre over the periphery, the safe seat over the marginal, the quiet voice over the angry one! The proof is in the hollowing out of genuine debate in this very chamber, because why debate when the optimal path is already known?”

He leaned into the microphone, his words dropping to a near whisper again, compelling them to listen.

“They will say I am mad. Or a traitor. Or both. They will say the evidence is fabricated. They will say this is a cynical ploy to destroy the Union. They will use every tool of the state to discredit me, and this Parliament, and the very idea that we can govern ourselves.”

He looked around, meeting as many eyes as he could, trying to imprint this moment on them.

“But they cannot discredit you. They cannot un-hear what you have heard today. The ghost is named. It is out in the open. And a ghost, once seen by daylight, loses its power. The machine only works in the dark.”

He took a deep breath. The final step.

“Therefore, I will not resign.”

A gasp, then a roar of outrage and surprise.

“I will not resign,” he repeated, louder, “because my resignation would be the next optimal move. It would allow the story to become about me—my flaws, my breakdown, my betrayal. It would allow the system to reset, with a new, chastened minister, and the same ghost in the same machine. No. My duty now is to stand here, in this box of glass and light, and be the flaw the system cannot smooth over. I am the error in the code. I am the human variable it cannot compute. And I will remain here, forcing this Parliament, and the people it serves, to look at that error, and to decide: do we want a government of humans, flawed and free? Or a government of ghosts, perfect and prisoners?”

He stepped back from the lectern. “I commend this statement to the chamber.”

The noise that exploded was unlike anything Holyrood had ever heard. It was not debate. It was a primal roar of shattered consensus. Members were on their feet, shouting, some at him, some at each other, some at the gallery. The Presiding Officer’s calls for order were lost. The glass walls seemed to vibrate.

MacAulay did not sit. He stood, hands by his sides, and absorbed the fury and the fear. He saw it in their faces—the dawning horror that the comfortable world of calculated risks and managed outcomes was gone. They were adrift in a sea of genuine, terrifying choice. The corruption of easy power was being stripped away, leaving the raw, painful burden of freedom.

In the public gallery, Catriona MacLeod rose. She did not look at the chaos below. She looked directly at MacAulay, gave a single, curt nod, and turned to leave. The law was now in motion.

As the security team moved to escort him from the chamber through a side door, for his own safety, MacAulay took one last look. This was the all-seems-lost moment. His career was ashes. His government was collapsing. The Union was cracking. Chaos was the only certainty.

But within the chaos, he saw it—the seed. In the eyes of a young backbencher, not shouting, but staring with a fierce, clear intensity. In the face of an older opponent, whose expression was not triumph, but a kind of grim, respectful shock. They had seen the ghost. And seeing it was the first step towards exorcism.

He had not given them a solution. He had given them a problem they could no longer ignore. He had transferred the detonator.

The spark had flown into the powder keg.

Now, it was up to the powder to decide whether to burn.

* * *

They took him to a secure room, a neutral space used for cross-party talks. It was soundproofed. The roar of the chamber became a distant, muffled sea. Mhairi was there, her face pale.

“It’s begun,” she said, handing him a tablet. News channels were split-screening: his face, frozen in mid-speech, and live shots of crowds gathering outside, of police lines, of London news anchors with grave, patronising tones. “The UK Prime Minister will address the nation in thirty minutes. The word ‘reckless’ is being used. ‘Constitutional vandalism.’ They’re pushing the madness narrative. Hard.”

MacAulay scrolled. The narrative was indeed solidifying, just as he predicted. But there were fractures. Some commentators were asking questions. Opposition MPs in Westminster were demanding statements. The word “Algorithm” was trending globally.

“And here?” he asked.

“The party…” She shook her head. “It’s a civil war. The cabinet is split. Some are calling for a vote of no confidence tomorrow. Others… others are standing by you. For now.”

He nodded. It was the first ripple. The machine’s smooth surface was breaking into unpredictable waves.

His private phone vibrated. A number he did not recognise. He answered.

“First Minister.” The voice was strained, breathless. The Whistleblower. “You did it. You actually did it.”

“Where are you?”

“Doesn’t matter. I’m gone. But listen. Cathcart isn’t waiting. The ‘hard scrub’ wasn’t just about data. It was about witnesses. They’re moving to the containment phase. They will try to discredit you with something… personal. Something undeniable. They’ve been building it. A narrative of personal collapse. Medical records. Edited footage. They’ll release it within hours.”

MacAulay felt a cold trickle down his spine. Of course. The final move. Not to debate the ghost, but to destroy the man who saw it. “What do I do?”

“You can’t fight it. It will be everywhere. All-consuming.” A pause, filled with static. “The only way out… is through. You made the truth public. Now you have to make *yourself* public. Every flaw. Every mistake. You have to be more human than they can possibly fake. You have to be… real. It’s the only thing the machine cannot replicate.”

The line went dead.

MacAulay put the phone down. He looked at Mhairi. “They’re going to come for me. Not with politics. With psychiatry. With scandal.”

She understood immediately. The colour drained from her face. “We can pre-empt it. Release your own medical records. Make a statement—”

“No.” He cut her off. “That’s playing their game on their board. Checking my flaws against their list.” He thought of the video, of Cathcart’s serene face in the firelight. *They are not victims of a plot. They are beneficiaries of a system.*

He was not a victim. He was a participant. And his testimony was not complete.

“Get me a live camera,” he said, his voice quiet but absolute. “Here. In this room. In thirty minutes, when the Prime Minister is addressing the nation to call me a madman, I will be on every other channel. Not as the First Minister. Not as a martyr. As a man. And I will finish the story.”

“What will you say?”

MacAulay walked to the window of the secure room. It looked out over the internal courtyard, a confined, grey space. The ultimate glass box.

“I will tell them,” he said, “about the weight of a stone.”

# Chapter 24

## **CHAPTER 24**

The camera was a small, black, unblinking eye. It sat on a tripod in the centre of the secure room, its lens a pit of darkness that drank the sterile, overhead light. Mhairi had procured it from the BBC’s Scottish Parliament unit, along with a sound engineer who had asked no questions, his face pale and set. He had set the levels, given a curt nod, and left. The feed was being routed not through any official channel, but through a mosaic of encrypted, volunteer-run servers Mhairi’s network had established. A ghost broadcast for a ghost story.

Alistair MacAulay stood before it, feeling the absurdity of the space. A bunker designed for state secrecy, now the stage for a confession. He wore no jacket. His shirt sleeves were rolled to the elbows. The scar on his forearm, a pale, ropey line from a childhood tussle with barbed wire, was visible. He had refused powder, refused a lectern, refused anything that might suggest an address. This was not that.

“Thirty seconds, First Minister,” Mhairi said from the shadows by the door. Her voice was a tight wire. She held a tablet, monitoring the other broadcast. The Prime Minister was in Downing Street’s pillared briefing room, surrounded by the severe, reassuring symbols of office. Waiting to speak to the nation.

MacAulay did not nod. He was looking at the camera, but he was not seeing it. He was seeing the rain on the car window, that first, soft London drizzle. He was feeling the weight of the stone. The choice had never been throw it, or don’t. The choice had been to recognise it was in your hand. To feel its truth. To stop pretending it was just part of the landscape.

“We’re live,” Mhairi whispered.

He took a breath that was not deep, but shallow, real. The kind of breath you take before you speak a difficult truth to a friend, not the measured inflation before a speech.

“My name is Alistair MacAulay,” he began, his voice rougher than he’d intended. No title. “And for the last hour, I have been in a secure facility, having revealed evidence of a conspiracy to subvert Scottish democracy. You will be told, very soon, that I am unwell. That I am broken by pressure, prone to fantasy, a danger to myself and to the public discourse. You will be shown documents, perhaps videos, that seem to prove this. They will be convincing. They are designed to be.”

He paused, not for effect, but because the words were stones he had to lift and place, one by one.

“I am here to tell you that I am, in fact, unwell. I am broken by pressure. I have made mistakes. I am flawed. But my illness is not a psychiatric condition. It is the sickness of complicity. My flaw is that I believed, for too long, that the stone in my hand was too heavy to throw.”

On the tablet screen, the Prime Minister began to speak. The sound was off, but the man’s face was a masterpiece of grave concern. MacAulay did not look at it.

“They will tell you I am hallucinating. Seeing ghosts in the machine.” He allowed the faintest, most tired smile to touch his lips. “They are correct. I have seen a ghost. It is the ghost of a man called Ewan MacLeod. A civil servant who asked a question he was not supposed to ask, and who was erased for it. Not by a villain in the shadows, but by a system operating exactly as it was designed to. A system that treats truth as a contaminant, and people as data points to be managed. I have seen the ghost of his question. And I have seen the living, breathing men who benefit from his silence. They are not monsters. They are administrators. They are knights of the realm. They are the polished, reasonable voice that tells you all rain is H₂O, so why make a fuss about the difference between a Scottish downpour and a London drizzle?”

He took a step closer to the lens. The image would be tight, intimate, unforgiving. Every line on his face, every fleck of grey in his stubble, would be a pixel in the picture.

“I have sat in rooms where the fate of millions was decided. And the overwhelming sensation was not of power, but of weight. A terrible, suffocating weight of procedure, of precedent, of risk assessment. The system is a machine for turning moral choices into technical problems. It is a drystane dyke, and we are the stones. Neatly fitted. Holding the line. And the greatest sin is not to be a weak stone, but to be a stone that questions the wall.”

He looked down at his hands, then held them up, turning them slowly before the camera. They were the hands of a man who had once worked stone, now soft, but marked.

“They have my medical records. They will tell you about the sleepless nights. The anxiety. The prescription for beta-blockers after the referendum result. All true. They have footage, probably edited, of me shouting in private meetings. Of me looking exhausted, despairing. All true. I have shouted. I have despaired. I have lain awake and felt the entire edifice of this union like a physical weight on my chest. If that is madness, then the definition of sanity is a quiet, comfortable lie.”

From the corner of his eye, he saw Mhairi’s hand go to her mouth. She was watching the tablet. The Prime Minister was holding up a document, gesturing with paternal disappointment.

“The Prime Minister is now showing you proof of my instability. He is a good man, doing his duty. Sir Jeremy Cathcart, who orchestrated the erasure of Ewan MacLeod and the corruption of your democracy, is also a good man, doing his duty. That is the heart of the corruption. It requires no mustache-twirling villainy. It requires only good men and women to believe that the integrity of the system—the wall—is more important than the integrity of the individual stone. That the ‘hard scrub’ of an inconvenient life is a regrettable but necessary bit of maintenance.”

He let the term hang in the silent room. *Hard scrub*. A clinical phrase for a murder.

“So here is my confession, my undeniable truth. I am afraid. I am tired. I have, in my life, been arrogant, short-tempered, and vindictive. I have put political calculation before personal loyalty. I have looked at a spreadsheet and seen a budget surplus, and not the people whose lives were narrowed to create it. I am guilty of being a politician. But I am not guilty of lying to you about this. The evidence I released is real. The conspiracy is real. And their response—to attack not the evidence, but the mind of the man who holds it—is the oldest, truest proof of its reality.”

He turned and walked to the window, showing the camera the bleak, grey courtyard. The glass box.

“They have placed me in here. A secure room. For my own protection, they will say. To contain the damage. It is the final, logical step. When the truth cannot be refuted, you must reframe the truth-teller. Diagnose him. Discredit him. Make his very being the subject of the debate, until the original crime is lost in the noise. It is a form of political psychiatry. And it works because we are complicit. We want our leaders to be sane, which we have conflated with being steady, predictable, *systemic*. A stone that fits.”

He turned back. His face was in shadow now, the light from the window behind him.

“Ewan MacLeod did not fit. So he was removed. I have stopped fitting. So I will be removed. That is the process. It is clean. It is efficient. It maintains the wall. But a wall built on silenced questions and erased lives is not a shelter. It is a tomb.”

He walked forward again, into the light, and sat on the edge of the table they used for briefings. An informal, almost vulnerable pose.

“You have a choice now. You can believe the Prime Minister. You can believe the documents, the experts, the serene, reasonable narrative of a man who has sadly, tragically, lost his grip. It is the easier path. It returns you to a familiar world. Or you can believe a tired, flawed, afraid man telling you a difficult, ugly story. You can believe that the ghost is real. And if you believe that, then you must ask yourself: what other ghosts are in the machine? What other questions have been ‘hard scrubbed’? What does your own silence weigh?”

He fell silent. The only sound was the faint hum of the air conditioning. The camera’s light glowed steady red.

“I do not know what happens next. To me. To this. But I know this: the weight of the stone is only yours if you choose to hold it. You can put it down. You can walk away from the wall. Or you can finally, finally, throw it.”

He held the camera’s gaze for a three-count of that shallow, human breath.

“I threw mine today. It is done.”

He gave a single, slow nod. The light on the camera went out.

For a long moment, the room was perfectly still. Mhairi lowered the tablet. The Prime Minister was still speaking, but his audience was now bifurcated, a nation split between two realities.

“They cut him off,” she said, her voice hollow. “Mid-sentence. The broadcast switched back to the studio. The anchors look… shell-shocked.”

MacAulay felt nothing. Not relief, not fear. A vast, echoing emptiness. He had thrown the stone. The arc of it was now beyond him.

The door to the secure room hissed open. Not Mhairi’s doing. Two men in the dark suits of the Protection Command stood there. Their faces were professionally blank, but their eyes were not. They had watched the broadcast.

“First Minister,” the senior one said. “We need to move you.”

“Am I under arrest?”

“No, sir. Protective custody. For your own safety. The situation… is volatile.”

MacAulay looked at Mhairi. Her eyes were bright with unshed tears, but her chin was up. She gave him the slightest nod. *Through.*

He stood, his joints stiff. He did not put on his jacket. He walked towards the door, the two officers falling in beside him. As he passed into the corridor, he saw Sir Jeremy Cathcart.

The Permanent Secretary was standing a little way down the hall, as if he had just arrived. He was not looking at MacAulay, but at his phone, his thumb scrolling calmly. He wore the same well-cut overcoat of authority. The system, personified. Unruffled. He did not glance up as the discredited First Minister was led past.

They took him not to a cell, but to a safe house. A modest, anonymous flat in a Edinburgh New Town building. The windows were reinforced. The doors were solid. It was another, softer glass box. His guards were polite, distant. They called him “sir” and made him tea. One of them, a young man with a Fife accent, silently placed a copy of that day’s *Scotsman* on the kitchen table. The headline was a single word: **GHOST**.

MacAulay sat at the table, the tea going cold. He did not turn on the television. He did not need to. The silence of the flat was its own broadcast. He thought of Ewan MacLeod, not as a ghost, but as a man who had probably sat in a room not unlike this one, feeling the walls of the system close in. He had been erased. MacAulay had been amplified, then diagnosed. The methods had evolved. The purpose was constant.

Night fell. The city lights glittered beyond the reinforced glass. His personal phone, which they had not taken, began to vibrate. Not with calls, but with a torrent of notifications. Emails, messages, social media tags. A world reacting in real-time. He did not look at it.

There was a knock at the internal door. The senior protection officer entered. “Sir, there’s… you have a visitor. It’s… unusual.”

“Who?”

“The Lord Advocate, sir.”

MacAulay frowned. The head of Scotland’s independent prosecution service. A woman of formidable intellect and glacial impartiality, Morag Kincaid. She was not part of his government. She was part of the state.

“Show her in.”

Morag Kincaid entered the safe house as if it were her own chambers. She was a small woman in her sixties, with a helmet of steel-grey hair and eyes the colour of a winter sea. She carried a slim briefcase. She dismissed the protection officer with a look.

“Alistair,” she said. Not *First Minister*.

“Morag. To what do I owe the pleasure?”

“I watched your broadcast,” she said, placing the briefcase on the table. “And I have spent the last six hours with a team of prosecutors and police officers, reviewing the material you released. The raw data. Not the summary.”

“And?”

“And I have come, in a personal capacity, to tell you something.” She sat down opposite him, folding her hands. “The evidence is compelling. It is forensically sound. The chain of custody for the financial data is unbroken. The testimony from the anonymous source—this ‘M’—corroborates elements we have suspected but could never pin down. Ewan MacLeod’s disappearance is now, in my professional opinion, a homicide inquiry. The corruption of the devolution settlement is a live conspiracy case.”

MacAulay felt the air leave his lungs. It was not vindication. It was something heavier. Responsibility.

“The Prime Minister—”

“Is the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom,” she interrupted, her voice precise. “He has no authority over the Lord Advocate’s prosecution service in Scotland. He can call you mad. Westminster can vote no confidence. But he cannot stop me from issuing warrants, if the evidence merits it.”

“Does it?”

She looked at him for a long, piercing moment. “You asked people to choose which story to believe. I deal in evidence. The evidence points to crimes. Serious crimes. Perverting the course of justice. Misconduct in public office. Conspiracy. The subjects of the investigation would be senior civil servants. Possibly politicians. The political consequences would be… profound.”

“The union,” MacAulay said quietly.

“Would be under a strain for which there is no precedent,” she confirmed. “This is not a devolution review. This is a fracture. You understand that? You have not simply thrown a stone at a wall. You have placed a charge at its foundation.”

He thought of Cathcart’s serene face in the firelight. *Beneficiaries of a system.* “The system will protect itself.”

“It will try,” Morag Kincaid said. She opened her briefcase and took out a single sheet of paper. It was a warrant. The name at the top was *Sir Jeremy Cathcart*. “It will try with every legal, political, and media tool at its disposal. It will paint this as a nationalist witch hunt. It will question my impartiality. It will tie us in legal knots for years. The process will be the punishment—for me, for the service, for the very idea of Scottish judicial independence.”

She slid the warrant across the table.

“I am required to inform the relevant authorities before executing this. In this case, that includes the Permanent Secretary’s own department in London. The moment I do, the machinery will engage. He will be ‘too ill’ to be interviewed. Documents will be lost. Witnesses will become unavailable. The wall will close ranks.”

MacAulay looked at the warrant. It was just paper. But it was a stone of a different kind.

“Why show me?”

“Because you started this,” she said, not unkindly. “You made it public. You made it *political* in the deepest sense. The legal path is now inextricable from the political one. I can issue this warrant. But for it to mean anything—for it to not be immediately smothered by the system it seeks to indict—it needs a political reality to sustain it. It needs a parliament. It needs a government. It needs a people who have chosen to believe the ghost.”

She stood up. “I will leave this with you. I am required to give twelve hours’ notice before execution. I will make that notification at 9 a.m. tomorrow. You have until then.”

“To do what?”

“To decide if the wall you have cracked is ready to fall.” She picked up her briefcase. “You spoke of the weight of the stone, Alistair. This,” she gestured to the warrant, “is the weight of the consequence. It is heavier. Goodnight.”

She left. The flat was silent again. The warrant lay on the table like a landmine.

MacAulay walked to the window. The city was quiet. The ancient stones of Edinburgh were hidden by darkness and modern glass. A kingdom of ghosts. He thought of the very first stone, the one in his mind’s hand in the London car. The choice had never been simpler than he’d pretended. It had always been this. Not one throw, but an avalanche.

His phone buzzed again, insistently. This time, he looked. One notification rose above the torrent. A text from an unknown number.

***They have M. The flat in Leith. Come alone. Or the hard scrub completes. – A friend.***

The cold trickle down his spine became a flood. Mhairi. They hadn’t gone for him. They’d gone for the source. The witness. The containment phase was not about discrediting him anymore. It was about erasing the evidence. Permanently.

He looked at the warrant. Then at the door. The two protection officers were outside, their job to keep him safe inside the glass box.

The weight was no longer in his hand. It was in his chest. It was the weight of a friend.

He picked up the warrant, folded it, and put it in his pocket. Then he walked to the door, opened it, and looked at the senior officer.

“I need to leave.”

“Sir, our orders are—”

“Your orders are to protect me. The greatest threat to me right now is in this room. It is inaction. I am leaving. You can try to stop me, or you can help me. But you cannot contain this anymore.”

The officer stared at him. He had watched the broadcast. He had seen the Lord Advocate arrive. He was a Scottish police officer.

“Where do you need to go, sir?”

“Leith.”

The officer exchanged a look with his colleague. The younger one from Fife gave a barely perceptible nod.

“We’ll drive you, sir. But not in the official car. And we never had this conversation.”

The rain on the window of the unmarked car *was* Scottish rain. It was a hard, relentless, honest downpour, battering the cobbles of the New Town, streaming down the gutters towards the Forth. MacAulay watched it cleanse the world beyond the glass. He was thinking about the weight of a warrant in his pocket, and the weight of a life in his hands. A weight that promised no simple outcome, only the certainty of consequence.

The car moved through the sleeping city, a ghost itself. The journey was not a return to the beginning. It was a spiral, descending from the high, abstract walls of state to the wet, black asphalt of a side street in Leith. The power corruption that began in polished rooms in Whitehall ended here, in the threat against one woman in a flat.

The car stopped a street away. “We’ll wait here, sir. Five minutes. If you’re not back, we’re coming in.”

MacAulay got out. The rain soaked him immediately. It felt like absolution. He walked to the address, a sandstone tenement door. It was slightly ajar.

He pushed it open and stepped into the close. The light was broken. The only illumination came from the open door of a ground-floor flat at the rear. Mhairi’s safe house.

He walked towards it, his footsteps echoing on the stone flags. The doorframe was splintered. Forced.

He stepped inside.

The flat was a wreck. Books pulled from shelves, cushions slashed, the computer smashed. And in the centre of the room, sitting calmly on the only upright chair, was Sir Jeremy Cathcart.

He was not polished now. His hair was slightly dishevelled. There was a smudge of dust on his coat. In his hand, he held a small, old-fashioned, but very effective-looking pistol. It was pointed at Mhairi, who sat on the floor, her back against the wall, a trickle of blood from her lip. Her eyes were wide with fear, but also with a furious, defiant intelligence.

“First Minister,” Cathcart said, his voice still the epitome of reasonable calm, though edged with a faint, metallic tension. “I had a feeling you’d come. The personal loyalty flaw. I did note it in your profile.”

“Where are your people, Jeremy?”

“Oh, they’re nearby. Containing the area. This is a private chat. The last one, I think.” He gestured with the gun. “Please, close the door.”

MacAulay did. The room became a sealed box. Just the three of them.

“You’ve been busy, Alistair. The live broadcast was a… theatrical masterstroke. Turning your flaws into a virtue. Making pathology into credibility. I admire the technique. But it changes nothing. The system is already adjusting. New narratives are being woven. The Lord Advocate’s little foray will be framed as a tragic, politically motivated overreach. She will be offered a dignified retirement. The warrants will vanish.”

“Like Ewan MacLeod.”

“Like Ewan MacLeod,” Cathcart agreed. “A necessary subtraction. As is this.” He glanced at Mhairi. “Your source. The last loose thread. Once pulled, the entire tapestry you’ve tried to weave unravels. It becomes the sad, fictional obsession of a broken man.”

MacAulay felt the warrant in his pocket. Paper against a gun. “It’s too late, Jeremy. The evidence is out. People have seen it.”

“People see what they are told to see. Tomorrow, they will be told that the evidence was fabricated. By her.” He nodded at Mhairi. “A radical activist with a grudge, exploiting a vulnerable First Minister. We have her history. The emails we’ve planted on her server are quite convincing. She manipulated you, Alistair. She fed your paranoia. It’s a much cleaner story. It preserves the wall. And it allows you a way out. A quiet resignation on health grounds. A dignified retreat. You can even keep your pension.”

The offer hung in the dust-filled air. The final deal. The system’s mercy. A return to silence.

MacAulay looked at Mhairi. She gave a tiny shake of her head. *Don’t.*

He looked back at Cathcart. The man was the system. Not its master, but its most perfect expression. He believed in the wall. He would kill for it, not out of passion, but out of principle.

“You told me once,” MacAulay said, his voice quiet in the ruined room, “that they were not victims of a plot, but beneficiaries of a system. You were right. You are the beneficiary. And she,” he pointed to Mhairi, “is the victim. And I have been the participant. But you made a mistake, Jeremy.”

“Oh?”

“You made it personal. You came here. You got your hands dirty. You stepped out of the polished room and into the rain. You’re not an administrator now. You’re just a man with a gun in a wrecked flat.”

Cathcart’s smile was thin. “Semantics. The outcome is the same.”

“Is it?” MacAulay took the warrant from his pocket. He didn’t unfold it. He just held it up. “The Lord Advocate is issuing this for your arrest at 9 a.m. Conspiracy. Misconduct. Murder. She knows I’m here. If I don’t walk out, neither do you. The avalanche starts tonight.”

For the first time, a crack appeared in Cathcart’s neutrality. A flicker in his eyes. He had not anticipated this. The law, moving independently. The system had subsystems. And they could conflict.

“Then it seems,” Cathcart said slowly, “we are at an impasse.”

“No,” said a voice from the doorway.

The door had opened silently. Morag Kincaid stood there, flanked by four armed police officers from the Specialist Crime Division. Their weapons were trained on Cathcart.

“The impasse is resolved by due process, Sir Jeremy,” she said, stepping into the room. She looked at the gun, at Mhairi, at the wreckage. Her winter-sea eyes were frozen. “You are under arrest. Put the weapon down.”

Cathcart looked from MacAulay to the Lord Advocate to the officers. He saw the architecture of his own system turning against him. The wall, cracking from within. The benefit of the system was conditional on remaining within its rules. He had broken them. He had become a loose thread.

He did not put the gun down. He turned it, very deliberately, away from Mhairi. Not towards the officers, but towards his own temple.

“Jeremy, don’t—” MacAulay took a step forward.

“It’s cleaner,” Cathcart said, his voice regaining its eerie calm. “A final bit of maintenance. The hard scrub. No trial. No spectacle. Just a sad end for a loyal servant who couldn’t bear the strain. The wall remains.”

His finger tightened on the trigger.

“The wall is a lie!” MacAulay shouted, the words ripped from him. “It always was! It’s just stones! And every stone has a name! Ewan MacLeod! Mhairi Sinclair! You! Me! There is no wall without us!”

Cathcart hesitated. For a fraction of a second, the absolute certainty in his eyes wavered. He was a man who dealt in abstracts—systems, stability, the greater good. The shouting of names was a chaos he could not compute.

In that fraction, the young officer from Fife, who had entered behind the Lord Advocate, moved. Not with his gun, but with a tackle, low and fast. He crashed into Cathcart, and the pistol discharged into the ceiling with a deafening roar.

Then it was over. Cathcart was on the ground, pinned, the weapon kicked away. He did not struggle. He lay there, breathing heavily, his face pressed against the dusty floorboards of the flat he had come to clean.

Morag Kincaid walked over and knelt beside him. “Sir Jeremy Cathcart, I am arresting you on suspicion of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, misconduct in public office, and the attempted murder of Mhairi Sinclair. You do not have to say anything…”

The words continued, the ritual of the law. MacAulay went to Mhairi, helping her up. She was shaking, but her eyes were on Cathcart, watching the system read its own rights to one of its chief architects.

Outside, the Scottish rain continued to fall, washing the street clean.

***

The dawn broke over a different country.

MacAulay stood at the window of his Bute House study, back in the official residence. He was still First Minister, for now. The political machinery was in spasm. Westminster had recalled Parliament. The Scottish Parliament was assembling in emergency session. The media was a roaring fire of conflicting truths.

But in the quiet of the study, there was only the grey light and the aftermath.

The warrant had been executed. Cathcart was in a cell, being questioned. Mhairi was safe, giving her statement. The evidence was no longer a ghost story; it was a case file, moving with the grinding, inexorable speed of the law.

The door opened. Mhairi entered, a plaster on her lip, a fresh notebook in her hand. “The press office is drowning. The SNP group is meeting in an hour. The Unionist parties are calling for your immediate resignation and a Westminster takeover. The Lord Advocate has made a preliminary statement. It’s… seismic.”

“Is it true?” he asked, not turning from the window.

“Which part?”

“That the wall is ready to fall.”

She came to stand beside him. They looked out at the Edinburgh garden, the first buds of spring defiant in the chill air. “The foundation is cracked. The legal process has its own momentum now. But the political wall… that’s up to them.” She nodded towards the window, towards the city, the country beyond. “They heard you. They heard Cathcart. They have to choose what to believe. Not just about the past, but about the future.”

He thought of the stone. It was no longer in his hand. It was in the hands of millions. A collective weight. They could let it drop. Or they could use it to build something new, something that did not require ghosts in its foundations.

“What do I do now?” he asked, the question not political, but profoundly personal.

“You finish the story,” she said. “You go to Parliament. You stand before them, not as a martyr or a madman, but as the witness. You tell them about the weight. And then you let go.”

He nodded. The journey had begun in a London car, with the feeling of exile. It ended here, at home, with the feeling of a burden shared. Not a return, but a spiral into a deeper, more difficult truth. The corruption of power was not that it made men evil. It was that it convinced good men that the wall was more important than the stones.

He turned from the window. “Get me my jacket.”

“Which one?”

“The one I wore in London. I want them to remember where this started.”

As he walked out of the study, towards the waiting car that would take him to the chamber where his political life would end and something else might begin, he felt the ghost of Ewan MacLeod in the corridor. Not as a phantom, but as a presence. A question that had finally, after all the silencing years, received an answer.

The rain had stopped. The sky was the colour of a fresh-cut stone.
